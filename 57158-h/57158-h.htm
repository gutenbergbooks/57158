<h1><span class="smaller">THE</span><br />
PUPPET SHOW OF MEMORY</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NURSERY</span></h2>

<p>When people sit down to write their recollections
they exclaim with regret, “If only I had kept a
diary, what a rich store of material I should now
have at my disposal!” I remember one of the masters at
Eton telling me, when I was a boy, that if I wished to make a
fortune when I was grown up, I had only to keep a detailed
diary of every day of my life at Eton. He said the same thing
to all the boys he knew, but I do not remember any boy of my
generation taking his wise advice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for the writer who wishes to recall past
memories, the absence of diaries and notebooks has its compensations.
Memory, as someone has said, is the greatest of
artists. It eliminates the unessential, and chooses with careless
skill the sights and the sounds and the episodes that are best
worth remembering and recording. The first thing I can
remember is a Christmas tree which I think celebrated the
Christmas of 1876. It was at Shoreham in Kent, at a house
belonging to Mr. H. B. Mildmay, who married one of my mother’s
sisters. I was two years old, and I remember my Christmas
present, a large bird with yellow and red plumage, which for a
long time afterwards lived at the top of the nursery wardrobe.
It was neither a bird of Paradise nor a pheasant; possibly only
a somewhat flamboyant hen; but I loved it dearly, and it
irradiated the nursery to me for at least two years.</p>

<p>The curtain then falls and rises again on the nursery of
37 Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London. The nursery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
epoch, which lasted till promotion to the schoolroom and lessons
began, seems to children as long as a lifetime, just as houses
and places seem to them infinitely large. The nursery was on
the third floor of the house, and looked out on to the street.
There was a small night-nursery next door to it, which had
coloured pictures of St. Petersburg on the wall.</p>

<p>I can remember the peculiar roar of London in those days;
the four-wheelers and hansoms rattling on the macadam pavement
through the fog, except when there was straw down in
the street for some sick person; and the various denizens of
the streets, the lamplighter and the muffin-man; often a
barrel-organ, constantly in summer a band, and sometimes a
Punch and Judy. During the war, when the streets began to
be darkened, but before the final complete darkness set in in
1917, London looked at night very much as it was in my childhood.
But the strange rumbling noise had gone for ever.
Sometimes on one of the houses opposite there used to be an
heraldic hatchment. The nursery was inhabited by my brother
Hugo and myself, our nurse, Hilly, and two nurserymaids,
Grace Hetherington, and Annie. Grace was annexed by me;
Annie by Hugo. Hilly had been nurse to my sisters and, I
think, to my elder brothers too. She had the slightly weather-beaten
but fresh agelessness of Nannies, and her most violent
threat was: “I’ll bring my old shoe to you,” and one of her
most frequent exclamations: “Oh, you naughty boy, you very
naughty boy!” The nursery had Landseer pictures in gilt
frames, and on the chest of drawers between the two windows
a mechanical toy of an entrancing description. It was a square
box, one side of which was made of glass, and behind this glass
curtain, on a small platform, a lady sat dressed in light blue
silk at an open spinet; a dancing master, in a red silk doublet
with a powdered wig and yellow satin knee-breeches, on one
side of it, conducted, and in the foreground a little girl in short
skirts of purple gauze covered with spangles stood ready to
dance. When you wound up the toy, the lady played, the man
conducted elegantly with an open score in one hand and a
baton in the other, and the little girl pirouetted. It only
played one short, melancholy, tinkling, but extremely refined
dance-tune.</p>

<p>At one of the top windows of the house opposite, a little
girl used to appear sometimes. Hugo and I used to exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
signals with her, and we called her Miss Rose. Our mute
acquaintance went on for a long time, but we never saw her
except across the street and at her window. We did not wish
to see more of her. Nearer acquaintance would have marred
the perfect romance of the relation.</p>

<p>There were two forms of light refreshment peculiar to
the nursery, and probably to all nurseries: one was Albert
biscuits, and the other toast-in-water. Children call for an
Albert biscuit as men ask for a whisky-and-soda at a club,
not from hunger, but as an adjunct to conversation and a
break in monotony. At night, after we had gone to bed, we
used often to ask monotonously and insistently for a drink of
water. “Hilly, I want a drink of water”; but this meant,
not that one was thirsty, but that one was frightened and
wanted to see a human being. All my brothers and sisters,
I found out afterwards, had done the same thing in the same
way, and for the same reason, but the tradition had been
handed down quite unconsciously. I can’t remember how the
nursery epoch came to an end; it merges in my memory
without any line of division, into the schoolroom period; but
the first visits in the country certainly belonged to the nursery
epoch.</p>

<p>We used to go in the summer to Coombe Cottage, near
Malden, an ivy-covered, red-brick house, with a tower at one
end, a cool oak hall and staircase, a drawing-room full of water-colours,
a room next to it full of books, with a drawing-table
and painting materials ready, and a long dining-room, of which
the narrow end was a sitting-room, and had a verandah looking
out on to the garden. There was also a kitchen garden, lawns,
a dairy, a gardener, Mr. Baker, who made nosegays, a deaf-and-dumb
under-gardener who spoke on his fingers, a farmyard,
and a duck-pond into which I remember falling.</p>

<p>Coombe was an enchanted spot for us. My recollection of
it is that of a place where it was always summer and where the
smell of summer and the sounds of summer evening used to
make the night-nursery a fairy place; and sometimes in the
morning, red-coated soldiers used to march past playing “The
Girl I left behind me,” with a band of drums and fifes. The
uniforms of the soldiers were as bright as the poppies in the
field, and that particular tune made a lasting impression on me.
I never forgot it. I can remember losing my first front tooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at Coombe by tying it on to a thread and slamming the door,
and I can remember my sisters singing, “Where are you going
to, my pretty Maid?” one of them acting the milkmaid, with
a wastepaper basket under her arm for a pail. Best of all, I
remember the garden, the roses, the fruit, trying to put salt
on a bird’s tail for the first time, and the wonderful games in
the hayfields.</p>

<p>We are probably all of us privileged at least once or twice
in our lives to experience the indescribable witchery of a perfect
summer night, when time seems to stand still, the world becomes
unsubstantial, and Nature is steeped in music and silver light,
quivering shadows and mysterious sound, when such a pitch
of beauty and glamour and mystery is achieved by the darkness,
the landscape, the birds, the insects, the trees and the shadows,
and perhaps the moon or even one star, that one would like to
say to the fleeting moment what Faust challenged and defied
the devil to compel him to cry out: “Verweile, Du bist schön.”</p>

<p>It is the moment that the great poets have sometimes caught
and made permanent for us by their prodigious conjury: Shakespeare,
in the end of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, when Lorenzo and
Jessica let the sounds of music creep into their ears, and
wonder at patines of bright gold in the floor of heaven; Keats,
when he wished to cease upon the midnight with no pain;
Musset, in the “Nuit de Mai”; Victor Hugo, when, on their
lovely brief and fatal bridal night, Hernani and Doña Sol fancy
in the moonlight that sleeping Nature is watching amorously
over them; and the musicians speak this magic with an even
greater certainty, without the need of words: Beethoven, in
his Sonata; Chopin, again and again; Schumann, in his lyrics,
especially “Frühlingsnacht”; Schubert, in his “Serenade.”</p>

<p>I have known many such nights: the dark nights of Central
Russia before the harvest ends, when the watchman’s rattle
punctuates and intensifies the huge silence, and a far-off stamping
dance rhythm and a bleating accordion outdo Shakespeare
and Schubert in magic; June nights in Florence, when you
couldn’t see the grass for fireflies, and the croaking of frogs
made a divine orchestra; or in Venice, on the glassy lagoon,
when streaks of red still hung in the west; May nights by the
Neckar at Heidelberg, loud with the jubilee of nightingales
and aromatic with lilac; a twilight in May at Arundel Park,
when large trees, dim lawns, and antlered shapes seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
part of a fairy revel; and nights in South Devon, when the
full September moon made the garden and the ilex tree as
unreal as Prospero’s island.</p>

<p>But I never in my whole life felt the spell so acutely as in
the summer evenings in the night nursery at Coombe Cottage,
when we went to bed by daylight and lay in our cots guessing
at the pattern on the wall, to wake up later when it was dark,
half conscious of the summer scents outside, and of a bird’s
song in the darkness. The intense magic of that moment I
have never quite recaptured, except when reading Keats’ “Ode
to the Nightingale” for the first time, when the door on to the
past was opened wide once more and the old vision and the
strange sense of awe, unreality, and enchantment returned.</p>

<p>But to go back to nursery life. Our London life followed
the ritual, I suppose, of most nurseries. In the morning after
our breakfast we went down, washed and scrubbed and starched,
into the dining-room, where breakfast was at nine, and kissed
our father before he drove to the city in a phaeton, and played
at the end of the dining-room round a pedestalled bust of one
of the Popes. Then a walk in the Park, and sometimes as a
treat a walk in the streets, and possibly a visit to Cremer’s, the
toy-shop in Bond Street. Hugo and I detested the Park, and
the only moment of real excitement I remember was when one
day Hilly told me not to go near the flower-beds, and I climbed
over the little railing and picked a towering hyacinth. Police
intervention was immediately threatened, and I think a policeman
actually did remonstrate; but although I felt for some
hours a pariah and an outcast, there was none the less an aftertaste
of triumph in the tears; attrition, perhaps, but no contrition.</p>

<p>When we got to be a little older … older than what? I
don’t know … but there came our moment when we joined
our sisters every morning to say our prayers in my mother’s
bedroom, every day before breakfast. They were short and
simple prayers—the “Our Father” and one other short prayer.
Nevertheless, for years the “Our Father” was to me a mysterious
and unintelligible formula, all the more so, as I said it entirely
by the sound, and not at all by the sense, thinking that
“Whichartinheaven” was one word and “Thykingdomcome”
another. I never asked what it meant. I think in some dim
way I felt that, could I understand it, something of its value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
as an invocation would be lost or diminished. I also remember
learning at a very early age the hymn, “There is a green hill
far away,” and finding it puzzling. I took it for granted
that most green hills had city walls round them, though this
particular one hadn’t. Besides going to Coombe we went at
the end of the summer to Devonshire, to Membland, near the
villages of Noss Mayo, and Newton, and not far from the river
Yealm, an arm of the sea. It was when getting ready for the
first of these journeys that I remember, while I was being
dressed in the nursery, my father’s servant, Mr. Deacon, came
up to the nursery and asked me whether I would like a ticket.
He then gave me a beautiful green ticket with a round hole in
it. I asked him what one could do with it, and he said, “In
return for that ticket you can get Bath buns, Banbury cakes,
jam-rolls, crackers, and pork sausages.” In the bustle of
departure I lost it. Paddington Station resounded with the
desperate cries of the bereaved ticket-holder. In vain I was
given half a white first-class ticket. In vain Mr. Bullock, the
guard, offered every other kind of ticket. It was not the same
thing. That ticket, with the round hole, had conjured up
visions of wonderful possibilities and fantastic exchanges.
Sausages and Banbury cakes and Bath buns (all of them magic
things), I knew, would be forthcoming to no other ticket. The
loss was irreparable. I remember thinking the grown-up people
so utterly wanting in understanding when they said: “A ticket?
Of course, he can have a ticket. Here’s a ticket for the dear
little boy.” As if that white ticket was anything like the
unique passport to gifts new and unheard of, anything like
that real green ticket with the round hole in it. At the end of
one of these journeys, at Kingsbridge Road, the train ran off the
line. We were in a saloon carriage, and I remember the accident
being attributed to that fact by my mother’s maid, who said
saloon carriages were always unsafe. It turned out to be an
enjoyable accident, and we all got out and I was given an
orange.</p>

<p>Mr. Bullock, the guard, was a great friend of all of us children;
and our chief pleasure was to ask him a riddle: “Why is it
dangerous to go out in the spring?” I will leave it to the
reader to guess the answer, with merely this as a guide, that the
first part of the answer to the riddle is “Because the hedges are
shooting,” and the second part of the answer is peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
appropriate to Mr. Bullock. I am afraid Mr. Bullock never
saw why, although no doubt he enjoyed the riddle.</p>

<p>I have already said that I cannot fix any line of division
between the nursery and the schoolroom epochs, but before I
get on to the subject of the schoolroom I will record a few things
which must have belonged to the pre-schoolroom period.</p>

<p>One incident which stands out clearly in my mind is that of
the fifty-shilling train. There were at that time in London
two toy-shops called Cremer. One was in New Bond Street,
No. 27, I think, near Tessier’s, the jeweller; another in Regent
Street, somewhere between Liberty’s and Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>In the window of the Regent Street shop there was a long
train with people in it, and it was labelled fifty shillings. In the
year 1921 it is only a small mechanical train that can be bought
for fifty shillings. I can’t remember whether I had reached
the schoolroom when this happened, but I know I still wore a
frock and had not yet reached the dignity of trousers. I used
constantly to ask to go and look at this shop window and gaze
at the fifty-shilling train, which seemed first to be miraculous
for its size, and, secondly, for its price. Who in the world could
have fifty shillings all at once?</p>

<p>I never went so far as thinking it was possible to possess
that train; but I used to wonder whether there were people
in the world who could store up fifty shillings. We were each
of us given sixpence every Saturday, but it was always spent
at once, nor could I calculate or even conceive how long it
would take to save enough sixpences to make fifty shillings.</p>

<p>One evening, when we were at Coombe, in the summer, I was
sent for to the drawing-room and then told to go into the dining-room.
I opened the door, and there, on the floor, was the fifty-shilling
train. If a fairy had flown into the room and lifted me
to the ceiling I could not have thought a fact more miraculous.
From that moment I knew for certain that miracles could
happen and do happen, and subsequent experience has confirmed
the belief. Alas! the funnel of the engine was soon
broken, and Mr. Toombs, the carpenter, was said to be able to
mend it, and I looked forward to another miracle. He did,
but in a way which was hardly satisfactory considered as a
miracle, although perfect for practical usage. He turned
on a lathe a solid funnel made of black wood, but not hollow,
and he stuck it in where the funnel ought to be. I pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I was satisfied, but my private belief was that Mr. Toombs
didn’t know how to make funnels.</p>

<p>Another thing which happened when I was six years old
was a visit to the Drury Lane pantomime, which was <i>Mother
Goose</i>. This, of course, with a transformation scene with a
large fairy with moving emerald butterfly-like wings and Arthur
Roberts who, when playing a trumpet, spat out all his teeth on
to the floor as if they were an encumbrance, was an ecstasy
beyond words.</p>

<p>Another event almost more exciting was the arrival of a
doll’s house. I played with dolls, but not as girls do, mothering
them and dressing them. Mine were little tiny dolls, and could
not be dressed or undressed, and they were used as puppets. I
made them open Parliament, act plays and stories, and most
frequently take the part of the French Merovingian kings.
This was at the beginning of the schoolroom period, and the
dolls were called Chilpéric, Ermengarde, Clothilde, Blanche de
Castille, Frédégonde, Brunehaut, Galswinthe, and Pépin le Bref,
and other names belonging to the same remote period of history.
One day I was told that a doll’s house was coming. I couldn’t
sleep for excitement, and Hilly, Grace, and Annie gravely held
a conclave one night when I was in bed and supposed to be
asleep, over their supper, and said that so exciting a thing as a
doll’s house ought not to be allowed me. It would ruin my
health. I feigned deep sleep, and the next day pretended to
have lost all interest in dolls’ houses, but when it came, all its
furniture was taken out, put on the floor, and arranged in two
long rows, with a throne at one end, to enable Chilpéric and
Frédégonde to open Parliament.</p>

<p>One year in London I actually saw Queen Victoria drive to
the opening of Parliament in a gilded coach with a little crown
perched on her head and an ermine tippet. It was not quite a
satisfactory crown, but still it was a crown, and the coach had
the authentic Cinderella quality.</p>

<p>To go back to the dolls for a moment. I used to go to
Membland sometimes for Easter with my father and mother
when the rest of the family stayed in London, and Margaret
used to write me letters from the dolls, beginning “Cher Papa”
and ending “Ermengarde” or “Chilpéric,” as the case might
be. These letters used to cover me with confusion and mortification
before the grown-up people, as I kept it a secret that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ever played with dolls, knowing it to be thought rather eccentric,
and liable to be misunderstood, especially when there were
other boys about, which there were.</p>

<p>Of course, in the nursery, Hugo and I had endless games of
pretending, especially during bath-time (baths were hip-baths),
and I remember Hugo refusing to have his bath because when
we were playing at fishes I seized the shark’s part and wouldn’t
let him be a shark. “Hilly,” he wailed, “I <i>will</i> be a shark.”
But no, I wouldn’t hear of it, and he had to be a whale, which
the shark, so I said, easily mastered.</p>

<p>Promotion to the schoolroom meant lessons and luncheon
downstairs. The schoolroom was inhabited by my three
sisters, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Susan, and ruled over by the
French governess, Chérie. I thought Chérie the most beautiful,
the cleverest, and altogether the most wonderful person in the
world. My earliest recollection of her almost magical powers
was when she took a lot of coloured silks and put them behind
a piece of glass and said this was <i>une vision</i>. I believed
there was nothing she didn’t know and nothing she couldn’t
do. I was also convinced that one day I would marry her.
This dream was sadly marred by the conduct of my sister
Elizabeth. Elizabeth was the eldest, Margaret the second, and
Susan the third, of my sisters. I firmly believed in fairies.
Elizabeth and Margaret fostered the belief by talking a great
deal about their powers as fairies, and Elizabeth said she was
Queen of the fairies. One day she said: “Just as you are
going to be married to Chérie, and when you are in church, I
will turn you into a frog.” This was said in the schoolroom in
London. The schoolroom was on the floor over the nursery.
No sooner had Elizabeth made this ominous remark when I
ran to the door and howled in a manner which penetrated the
whole house from the housemaids’ rooms upstairs to the housekeeper’s
room in the basement. Screams and yells startled the
whole house. Hilly came rushing from the nursery; Chérie
came from her bedroom, where she had been doing some sewing;
Dimmock, my mother’s maid, whom we called D., came downstairs,
saying: “Well, I never”; Sheppy, the housekeeper, peered
upwards from the subterranean housekeeper’s room; and, lastly,
my mother came from the drawing-room. The cause of the
crisis was explained by me through sobs. “She says” …
sob, sob, yell … “that she’s a fairy” … sob, sob …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
“and that she’ll turn me into a frog” … sob, sob … “when
I marry Chérie…” All attempts to calm me were in vain.
Elizabeth was then appealed to, and the whole house in chorus
said to her, “Say you’re not a fairy.” But Elizabeth became
marble-constant. She said, “How can I say I’m not a fairy
when I am one?” A statement which I felt to be all too true
and well founded. More sobs and yells. Universal indignation
against Elizabeth. My paroxysm was merely increased by all
the efforts everyone made to soothe me. Elizabeth was cajoled,
persuaded, argued with, bribed, threatened, exhorted, blamed,
anathematised, entreated, appealed to, implored, but all in
vain. She would not budge from her position, which was that
she <i>was</i> a fairy.</p>

<p>The drama proceeded. Nothing stopped the stream of
convulsive sobs, the flood of anguish—not all Chérie’s own
assurances that the wedding would be allowed to take place.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was taken downstairs to be reasoned with, and
after an hour and a half’s argument, and not before she had
been first heavily bribed with promises and then sent to bed,
she finally consented to compromise. She said, as a final
concession, “I’ll say I’m not a fairy, but I am.” When this
concession was wrung from her the whole relieved household
rushed up to tell me the good news that Elizabeth had said she
was not a fairy. The moment I heard the news my tears
ceased, and perfect serenity was restored. But although
Elizabeth capitulated, Margaret was firmer, and she continued
to mutter (like Galileo) for the rest of the afternoon, “But <i>I</i>
am a fairy all the same.”</p>

<p>Margaret was the exciting element in the schoolroom. She
was often naughty, and I remember her looking through the
schoolroom window at Coombe, while I was doing lessons
with Chérie, and making faces. Chérie said to her one day:
“Vous feriez rougir un régiment.” Elizabeth was pleasantly
frivolous, and Susan was motherly and sensible, and supposed
to be the image of her father, but Margaret was dramatic and
imaginative, and invincibly obstinate.</p>

<p>She knew that for Chérie’s sake I didn’t like admitting that
the English had ever defeated the French in battle, so every
now and then she would roll out lists of battles fought by the
English against the French and won, beginning with Creçy,
Poitiers, getting to Agincourt with a crescendo, and ending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
up in a tremendous climax with Waterloo. To which I used to
retort with a battle called Bouvines, won by Philippe Auguste,
in some most obscure period over one of the Plantagenet kings,
and with Fontenoy. I felt them both to be poor retorts.</p>

<p>Another invention of Margaret’s was a mysterious Princess
called Louiseaunt, who often came to see her, but as it happened
always when we were out. If we suddenly came into the room,
Margaret would say, “What a pity! Louiseaunt has just been
here. She’ll be so sorry to have missed you.” And try as we
would, we always just missed Louiseaunt.</p>

<p>If we went out without Margaret, Louiseaunt was sure to
come that day. We constantly just arrived as Louiseaunt had
left, and the inability ever to hit off Louiseaunt’s precise visiting
hours was a lasting exasperation.</p>

<p>Another powerful weapon of Margaret’s was recitation. She
used to recite in English and in French, and in both languages
the effect on me was a purge of pity and terror. I minded most
“Lord Ullin’s Daughter,” declaimed with melodramatic gesture,
and nearly as much a passage from <i>Hernani</i>, beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Monts d’Aragon! Galice! Estramadoure!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! Je porte malheur à tout ce qui m’entoure!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which she recited, rolling her eyes in a menacing attitude.</p>

<p>“Lord Ullin’s Daughter,” said with the help of Susan, whose
rendering had something reassuringly comfortable and homely
about it—Susan couldn’t say her “r’s,” and pronounced them like
“w’s”—in contradistinction to Margaret’s sombre and vehement
violence, did a little to mitigate the effect, but none the less it
frightened me so much that it had to be stopped. Hugo was
not yet in the schoolroom then.</p>

<p>Lessons in London began soon after breakfast. They were
conducted by Chérie and by an English governess, Mrs. Christie,
who used to arrive in a four-wheeler, always the same one, from
Kentish Town, and teach us English, Arithmetic, and Latin.
Mrs. Christie was like the pictures of Thackeray, with spectacles,
white bandeaux, and a black gown. During lessons she used to
knit. She was in permanent mourning, and we knew we must
never ask to learn “Casabianca,” as her little boy who had died
had learnt it. She used to arrive with a parcel of books from
the London Library, done up in a leather strap. She was the
first of a long line of teachers who failed to teach me Arithmetic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
She used to stay the whole morning, or sometimes only part of
it. During lessons she used to have a small collation, a glass of
claret, and a water biscuit. She also taught other families.</p>

<p>At Coombe the schoolroom looked out on the lawn, a long, flat
lawn which went down by steps on a lower lawn, at the bottom of
which we had our own gardens and where there was a summer-house.
I remember sitting in the schoolroom next to Chérie
while, with a large knitting needle, she pointed out the words <i>pain</i>
and <i>vin</i> written large in a copy-book, with a picture of a bottle
of red wine and a picture of a piece of bread, to show what the
words meant, while Margaret was copying out Clarence’s dream
in a copy-book and murmuring something about skulls, and
all the time through the window framed with clematis came
the sound, the magic sound of the mowing-machine, the noise
of bees, and a smell of summer, tea-roses and of hayfields.</p>

<p>On certain days of the week Mademoiselle Ida Henry used to
come and give us music lessons. Our house was saturated with
an atmosphere of music. My mother played the violin and was
a fine concertina player, and almost before I could walk I had
violin lessons from no less a person than Mr. Ries. Until
I was three I was called <i>Strad</i>, and I think my mother cherished
the dream that I would be a violinist, but I showed no aptitude.</p>

<p>My first music lesson I received from Mademoiselle Ida over
Stanley Lucas’ music shop in Bond Street. I was alone in
London with my mother and father, one November, and I
suppose about six. Mademoiselle Ida was very encouraging,
and—unduly, as it turned out—optimistic, and said: “Il a
des mains faites pour jouer le piano,” and soon my <i>morceau</i>
was Diabelli’s duets. While I was learning Diabelli’s duets,
Susan was learning a Fantasia by Mozart, which I envied without
malice. It had one particular little run in it which I learnt to
play with one finger. One day I played this downstairs in the
drawing-room. A few days later Mademoiselle Ida came to
luncheon, and my mother said: “Play that little bar out of the
Mozart to Mademoiselle Ida.” I was aghast, feeling certain,
and quite rightly, that Mademoiselle Ida would resent my
having encroached on a more advanced <i>morceau</i>, and indeed,
as it became clear to her what the bar in question was, she at
once said: “Je ne veux pas que tu te mêles des morceaux des
autres.” That was what I had feared. My mother was quite
unconscious of the solecism that she was committing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pressed me to play it. Finally I hummed the tune, which
satisfied both parties.</p>

<p>I never liked music lessons then or ever afterwards, but I
enjoyed Mademoiselle Ida’s conversation and company almost
more than anything. Every word she ever said was treasured.
One day she said to Mrs. Christie: “Bonjour, Madame Christé.
J’ai bien mal à la tête.” “Je suis très fachée de le savoir,
Mademoiselle Henri,” said Mrs. Christie in icy tones, and this
little dialogue was not destined ever to be forgotten by any
of us. We used often afterwards to enact the scene.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Susan learnt the piano, and Margaret was
taught the violin by Herr Ludwig, a severe German master.
John, my eldest brother, was an accomplished pianist and
organist; Everard, my third brother, played the piccolo. Cecil
sang, and my mother was always bewailing that he had not
learnt music at Eton, because his house-master said it would be
more useful for him to learn how to shoe a horse. This, alas!
did not prove to be the case, as he has seldom since had the
opportunity of making use of his skill as a blacksmith. The
brothers were all at Eton when I first went into the schoolroom,
but they often used to visit us in the evening at tea-time, and
sometimes they used to listen when Chérie read aloud after tea.</p>

<p>Echoes of the popular songs of the day reached both the
nursery and the schoolroom, and the first I can remember the
tunes of are: “Pop goes the Weasel,” which used to be sung to
me in the nursery; “Tommy, make room for your Uncle”; “My
Grandfather’s Clock”; “Little Buttercup” from <i>Pinafore</i>,
which used to be played on a musical box; “Oh where and oh
where is my little wee Dog?” with its haunting refrain.</p>

<p>Later we used to sing in chorus and dancing a <i>pas de trois</i>, a
song from a Gaiety burlesque:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We’ll never come back any more, boys,</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll never come back any more.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, later still, someone brought back to London for Christmas
the unforgettable tune of “Two Lovely Black Eyes,”
which in after-life I heard all over the world—on the lagoon
of Venice and in the villages of Mongolia.</p>

<p>One day after luncheon—on Sunday—John played the “Two
Grenadiers” at the pianoforte, and I remember the experience
being thrilling, if a little alarming, but a revelation, and a
first introduction into the world of music.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NURSERY AND THE SCHOOLROOM</span></h2>

<p>Life was divided between London from January to
August, then Devonshire till after Christmas. In
the nursery and the early part of the schoolroom
period we used to go to Coombe in the summer. Coombe
seemed to be inextricably interwoven with London and parallel
to it; and I remember dinner-parties happening, and a Hungarian
band playing on the lawn, unless I have dreamt that.
But there came a time, I think I must have been six or seven,
when Coombe was sold, and we went there no more, and life
was confined to Membland and Charles Street. London in the
winter, and summer in Devonshire, with sometimes brief visits
to Devonshire at Easter and Whitsuntide, and brief visits to
London in November, when my father and mother went up by
themselves.</p>

<p>It is not any false illusion or the glamour of the past that
makes the whole of that period of life until school-time was
reached seem like fairyland. I thought so at the time, and
grown-up people who came to Coombe and Membland felt,
I think, that they had come to a place of rare and radiant
happiness.</p>

<p>But I will begin with London first.</p>

<p>This was the routine of life. We all had breakfast at nine
downstairs. I remember asking how old my father was, and
the answer was fifty-three. As he was born in 1828 and I was
born in 1874, I must have been seven years old at the time of this
question. I always thought of my father as fifty-three years old.
My brothers John, Cecil, and Everard were at Eton at Warre’s
House, and Hugo was five years old and still in the nursery.</p>

<p>After breakfast, at about a quarter to ten, my father drove
to the City, and he never came home to luncheon except on
Saturdays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>We went for a walk with Chérie, and after this lessons
lasted from eleven, I think, till two, in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>The schoolroom was a long room with three windows looking
out on to the street. There was a cottage pianoforte at an
angle, and in the niche of one of the windows a small table,
where Chérie used to sit and read the <i>Daily News</i> in the morning.
We each of us had a cupboard for our toys, and there were some
tall bookcases, containing all the schoolroom books, Noel and
Chapsal’s Grammar, and many comfortable, shabby books of
fairy-tales. We each of us had a black writing-desk, with a
wooden seat attached to it, in which we kept our copybooks,
and at which we did our work. A long table ran right down
the middle of our room, where we did our lessons, either when
everyone did them together, collectively, with Chérie, who sat
at the head of the table, or with Mrs. Christie, who sat at one
side of the table at the farther end.</p>

<p>At two o’clock we all came down to luncheon, and as my
mother was at home to luncheon every day, stray people used
to drop in, and that was a great excitement, as the guests used
to be discussed for hours afterwards in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy Nevill, who lived in the same street, used
often to come to luncheon and make paper boats for me. She
used also to shock me by her frank expression of Tory principle,
not to say prejudice, as we were staunch Liberals, and Lady
Dorothy used to say that Mr. Gladstone was a dreadful man.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Montgomery was a luncheon visitor, and one
day Bobby Spencer, who was afterwards to be Margaret’s
husband, was subjected to a rather sharp schoolroom criticism
owing to the height of his collars. I sometimes used to embarrass
Chérie by sudden interpellations. One day, when she
had refused a dish, I said: “Prends en, Chérie, toi qui es si
gourmande.” Another day at luncheon a visitor called Colonel
Edgcumbe bet my mother a pound there would be war with
France within three years. I expect he forgot the bet, but I
never did. Another time my mother asked Mademoiselle Ida
what was the most difficult piece that existed for the pianoforte,
and Mademoiselle Ida said Liszt’s “Spinnelied.” My mother bet
her a pound she would learn it in a month’s time (and she did).</p>

<p>There were two courses at luncheon, some meat and a sweet,
and then cheese, and we were not allowed to have the sweet
unless we had the meat first, but we could always have two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
helpings if we liked. After luncheon we went for another walk.
At five there were more lessons, and then schoolroom tea, presided
over by Chérie, and after that various games and occupations,
and sometimes a visit to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>There were two drawing-rooms downstairs, a front drawing-room
with three windows looking out on to the street, and a
back drawing-room at right angles to it. The drawing-rooms
had a faded green silk on the walls. Over the chimney-piece
there was a fine picture by Cuyp, which years later I saw
in a private house in the Bois de Boulogne. The room was
full of flowers and green Sèvres china. In the back drawing-room
there was a grand pianoforte and some bookcases, and
beyond that a room called the gilding-room, a kind of workshop
where my mother did gilding. I only once saw a part of the
operation, which consisted of making size. Later on this room
became the organ room and was enlarged. The drawing-room
led to a small landing and a short staircase to the front hall.
On the landing wall there was an enormous picture of Venice,
by Birket Foster, and from this landing, when there was a
dinner-party, we used to peer through the banisters and watch
the guests arriving. We were especially forbidden to slide
down the banisters, as my mother used to tell us that when she
was a little girl she had slid down the banisters and had a terrible
fall which had cut open her throat, so that when you put a
spoon in her mouth it came out again through her throat.
When Hugo, the last of the family to be told this story, heard
it, he said, “Did you die?” And my mother was obliged to
say that she did not.</p>

<p>On the ground floor was a room looking out into the street,
called the library, but it only possessed two bookcases let into
Louis <span class="smcapuc">XV.</span> white walls, and this led into the dining-room, beyond
which was my father’s dressing-room, where, when we were
quite small, we would watch him shave in the morning.</p>

<p>Dinner downstairs was at eight, and when we were small I
was often allowed to go down to the beginning of dinner and
draw at the dinner-table on a piece of paper, and the girls used
to come down to dessert, bringing an occupation such as needlework.
We were always supposed to have an occupation when we
were downstairs, and I remember Susan, being asked by Chérie
what needlework she was going to take to the dining-room,
saying: “Mon bas, ma chemise, et ma petite wobe, Chéwie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>On Saturday afternoons we often had a treat, and went to
the German Reed’s entertainment and Corney Grain, or to
Maskelyne and Cook, and Hengler’s Circus, and on Sundays
we often went to the Zoo, or drove down to Coombe when
Coombe existed.</p>

<p>Lessons were in the hands of Chérie and Mrs. Christie.
Chérie taught me to read and write in French, French history
out of Lamé Fleury, not without arguments on my part to
learn it from the bigger grown-up book of Guizot, and French
poetry. Every day began with a hideous ordeal called “La
Page d’Ecriture.” Chérie would write a phrase in enormous
letters in a beautiful copy-book handwriting on the top line of
the copy-book, and we had to copy the sentence on every other
line, with a quill pen. Mrs. Christie, besides struggling with
my arithmetic, used to teach us English literature, and make
us learn passages from Shakespeare by heart, which were quite
unintelligible to me, and passages from Byron, Walter Scott,
Campbell, and Southey, and various pieces from the <i>Children’s
Garland</i> and Macaulay’s <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>. I enjoyed
the latter whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mrs. Christie and Chérie used to have conversations
across the children, as it were, during lessons. I remember
Mrs. Christie saying to Chérie while I was doing my lessons by
Chérie’s side one day: “That child will give you more trouble
than all the others.”</p>

<p>I liked history lessons, especially Lamé Fleury’s French
history and mythology; and in Lamé Fleury’s French history
the favourite chapter was that beginning: “Jean <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> dit le bon
commença son règne par un assassinat.” The first book I read
with Mrs. Christie was called <i>Little Willie</i>, and described the
building of a house, an enchanting book. I did not like any
of the English poetry we read, not understanding how by any
stretch of the imagination it could be called poetry, as Shakespeare
blank verse seemed to be a complicated form of prose
full of uncouth words; what we learnt being Clarence’s
dream, King Henry <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>’s battle speeches, which made me most
uncomfortable for Chérie’s sake by their anti-French tone, and
passages from <i>Childe Harold</i>, which I also found difficult to
understand. The only poems I remember liking, which were
revealed by Mrs. Christie, were Milton’s <i>L’Allegro</i> and <i>Penseroso</i>,
which I copied out in a book as soon as I could write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
One day she read me out Gray’s <i>Elegy</i> and I was greatly impressed.
“That is,” she said, “the most beautiful Elegy in the
language.” “Is it the most beautiful poem in the language?”
I asked, rather disappointed at the qualification, and hankering
for an absolute judgment. “It’s the most beautiful <i>Elegy</i> in
the language,” she said, and I had to be content with that.</p>

<p>I don’t want to give the impression that we, any of us, disliked
Mrs. Christie’s lessons in English literature. On the contrary,
we enjoyed them, and I am grateful for them till this day.
She taught us nothing soppy nor second-rate. The piece of her
repertoire I most enjoyed, almost best, was a fable by Gay called
“The Fox at the Point of Death.” She was always willing
to explain things, and took for granted that when we didn’t
ask we knew. This was not always the case. One of the pieces
I learnt by heart was Shelley’s “Arethusa,” the sound of which
fascinated me. But I had not the remotest idea that it was
about a river. The poem begins, as it will be remembered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Arethusa arose</div>
<div class="verse">From her couch of snows</div>
<div class="verse">In the Acroceraunian mountains.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For years I thought “Acroceraunian” was a kind of pin-cushion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Christie had a passion for Sir Walter Scott and for the
Waverley Novels. “You can’t help,” she said, “liking any
King of England that Sir Walter Scott has written about.”
She instilled into us a longing to read Sir Walter Scott by promising
that we should read them when we were older. One of
the most interesting discussions to me was that between Chérie
and Mrs. Christie as to what English books the girls should be
allowed to read in the country. Mrs. Christie told, to illustrate
a point, the following story. A French lady had once
come across a French translation of an English novel, and seeing
it was an English novel had at once given it to her daughter to
read, as she said, of course, any English novel was fit for the
<i>jeune personne</i>. The novel was called <i>Les Papillons de Nuit</i>.
“And what do you think that was?” said Mrs. Christie.
“<i>Moths</i>, by Ouida!”</p>

<p>The first poem that really moved me was not shown me by
Mrs. Christie, but by Mantle, the maid who looked after the girls.
It was Mrs. Hemans’: “Oh, call my Brother back to me, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
play alone.” This poem made me sob. I still think it is a
beautiful and profoundly moving poem. Besides English, Mrs.
Christie used to teach us Latin. I had my first Latin lesson the
day after my eighth birthday. This is how it began: “Supposing,”
said Mrs. Christie, “you knocked at the door and the
person inside said, ‘Who’s there?’ What would you say?”
I thought a little, and then half-unconsciously said, “I.”
“Then,” said Mrs. Christie, “that shows you have a natural
gift for grammar.” She explained that I ought reasonably
to have said “Me.” Why I said “I,” I cannot think. I had
no notion what her question was aiming at, and I feel certain
I should have said “Me” in real life. The good grammar was
quite unintentional.</p>

<p>As for arithmetic, it was an unmixed pain, and there was an
arithmetic book called <i>Ibbister</i> which represented to me the final
expression of what was loathsome. One day in a passion with
Chérie I searched my mind for the most scathing insult I could
think of, and then cried out, “Vieille Ibbister.”</p>

<p>I learnt to read very quickly, in French first. In the nursery
Grace and Annie read me <i>Grimm’s Fairy Tales</i> till they were
hoarse, and as soon as I could read myself I devoured any book
of fairy-tales within reach, and a great many other books; but I
was not precocious in reading, and found grown-up books impossible
to understand. One of my favourite books later was
<i>The Crofton Boys</i>, which Mrs. Christie gave me on 6th November
1883, as a “prize for successful card-playing.” It is very
difficult for me to understand now how a child could have
enjoyed the intensely sermonising tone of this book, but I
certainly did enjoy it.</p>

<p>I remember another book called <i>Romance</i>, or <i>Chivalry and
Romance</i>. In it there was a story of a damsel who was really
a fairy, and a bad fairy at that, who went into a cathedral
in the guise of a beautiful princess, and when the bell rang at
the Elevation of the Host, changed into her true shape and
vanished. I consulted Mrs. Christie as to what the Elevation
of the Host meant, and she gave me a clear account of what
Transubstantiation meant, and she told me about Henry <span class="smcapuc">VIII.</span>,
the Defender of the Faith, and the Reformation, and made no
comment on the truth or untruth of the dogma. Transubstantiation
seemed to me the most natural thing in the world,
as it always does to children, and I privately made up my mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that on that point the Reformers must have been mistaken.
One day Chérie said for every <i>devoir</i> I did, and for every time I
wasn’t naughty, I should be given a counter, and if I got twenty
counters in three days I should get a prize. I got the twenty
counters and sallied off to Hatchard’s to get the prize. I chose
a book called <i>The Prince of the Hundred Soups</i> because of its
cover. It was by Vernon Lee, an Italian puppet-show in
narrative, about a Doge who had to eat a particular kind of
soup every day for a hundred days. It is a delightful story,
and I revelled in it. On the title-page it was said that the
book was by the author of <i>Belcaro</i>. I resolved to get <i>Belcaro</i>
some day; <i>Belcaro</i> sounded a most promising name, rich in
possible romance and adventure, and I saved up my money
for the purpose. When, after weeks, I had amassed the
necessary six shillings, I went back to Hatchard’s and bought
<i>Belcaro</i>. Alas, it was an æsthetic treatise of the stiffest and
driest and most grown-up kind. Years afterwards I told
Vernon Lee this story, and she promised to write me another
story instead of <i>Belcaro</i>, like <i>The Prince of the Hundred Soups</i>.
The first book I read to myself was <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, which
John gave to me. Another book I remember enjoying very
much was <i>The King of the Golden River</i>, by Ruskin.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my French lessons infinitely more than my English
ones. French poetry seemed to be the real thing, quite
different from the prosaic English blank verse, except La
Fontaine’s <i>Fables</i>, which, although sometimes amusing, seemed
to be almost as prosy as Shakespeare. They had to be learnt
by heart, nevertheless. They seemed to be in the same relation
to other poems, Victor Hugo’s “Napoléon II.” and “Dans
L’Alcove sombre,” which I thought quite enchanting, as meat
was to pudding at luncheon, and I was not allowed to indulge
in poetry until I had done my fable, but not without much
argument. I sometimes overbore Chérie’s will, but she more
often got her way by saying: “Tu as toujours voulu écrire
avec un stylo avant de savoir écrire avec une plume.” I learnt
a great many French poems by heart, and made sometimes
startling use of the vocabulary. One day at luncheon I said
to Chérie before the assembled company: “Chérie, comme ton
front est nubile!” the word <i>nubile</i> having been applied by the
poet, Casimir de la Vigne, to Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>The first French poem which really fired my imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was a passage from <i>Les Enfants d’Édouard</i>, a play by the same
poet, in which one of the little princes tells a dream, which
Margaret used to recite in bloodcurdling tones, and his brother,
the Duke of York, answers lyrically something about the sunset
on the Thames.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Those lines fired my imagination as nothing
else did. We once acted a scene from this play, Margaret and
I playing the two brothers, and Susan the tearful and widowed
queen and mother, and Hugo as a beefeater, who had to bawl
at the top of his voice: “Reine, retirez-vous!” when the queen’s
sobs became excessive, and indeed in Susan’s rendering there
was nothing wanting in the way of sobs, as she was a facile
weeper, and Margaret used to call her “Madame la Pluie.”
Indeed there was a legend in the schoolroom that the decline
of Louis <span class="smcapuc">XIV.</span>, King of France, moved her to tears, and being
asked why she was crying, she sobbed out the words: “la
vieillesse du grand Woi.”</p>

<p>As far back as I remember we used to act plays in French.
The first one performed in the back drawing-room in Charles
Street was called <i>Comme on fait son lit on se couche</i>, and I played
some part in it which I afterwards almost regretted, as whenever
a visitor came to luncheon I was asked to say a particular
phrase out of it, and generally refused. This was not either
from obstinacy or naughtiness; it was simply to spare my
mother humiliation. I was sure grown-up people could not
help thinking the performance inadequate and trifling. I was
simply covered with prospective shame and wished to spare
them the same feeling. One day, when a Frenchman, Monsieur
de Jaucourt, came to luncheon, I refused to say the sentence
in question, in spite of the most tempting bribes, simply for
that reason. I was hot with shame at thinking what Monsieur
de Jaucourt—he a Frenchman, too—would think of something
so inadequate. And this shows how impossible it is for grown-up
people to put themselves in children’s shoes and to divine
their motives. If only children knew, it didn’t matter what
they said!</p>

<p>Another dramatic performance was a scene from Victor
Hugo’s drama, <i>Angelo</i>, in which Margaret, dressed in a crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
velvet cloak bordered with gold braid, declaimed a speech of
Angelo Podesta of Padua, about the Council of Ten at Venice,
while Susan, dressed in pink satin and lace, sat silent and
attentive, looking meek in the part of the Venetian courtesan.</p>

<p>All this happened during early years in London.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Ida used to enliven lessons with news from
the outside world, discussions of books and concerts, and especially
of other artists. One day when I was sitting at my slate
with Mrs. Christie, she was discussing English spelling, and saying
how difficult it was. Mrs. Christie rashly said that I could
spell very well, upon which Mademoiselle Ida said to me, “You
would spell ‘which’ double u i c h, wouldn’t you?” And I,
anxious to oblige, said, “Yes.” This was a bitter humiliation.</p>

<p>Besides music lessons we had drawing lessons, first from a
Miss Van Sturmer. Later we had lessons from Mr. Nathaniel
Green, a water-colourist, who taught us perspective. One year
I drew the schoolroom clock, which Mr. Jump used to come to
wind once a week, as a present for my mother on her birthday,
the 18th of June.</p>

<p>Sometimes I shared my mother’s lesson in water-colours.
Mr. Green used to say he liked my washes, as they were warm.
He used to put his brush in his mouth, which I considered
dangerous, and he sometimes used a colour called Antwerp
blue, which I thought was a pity, as it was supposed to fade.
I was passionately fond of drawing, and drew both indoors and
out of doors on every possible opportunity, and constantly
illustrated various episodes in our life, or books that were
being read out at the time. I took an immense interest in my
mother’s painting, especially in the colours: Rubens madder,
cyanine, aureoline, green oxide of chromium, transparent—all
seemed to be magic names. The draughtsman of the family
was Elizabeth. None of my brothers drew. Elizabeth used
to paint a bust of Clytie in oils, and sometimes she went as far
as life-size portraits. Besides this, she was an excellent caricaturist,
and used to illustrate the main episodes of our family
life in a little sketch-book.</p>

<p>Lessons, on the whole, used to pass off peacefully. I
don’t think we were ever naughty with Mrs. Christie, although
Elizabeth and Margaret used often to rock with laughter at
some private joke of their own during their lessons, but with
Chérie we were often naughty. The usual punishment was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
be <i>privé de pudding</i>. When the currant and raspberry tart
came round at luncheon we used to refuse it, and my mother
used to press it on us, not knowing that we had been <i>privé</i>.
Sometimes, too, we had to write out three tenses of the verb
<i>aimer</i>, and on one occasion I refused to do it. It was a Saturday
afternoon; there was a treat impending, and I was told I would
not be allowed to go unless I copied out the tenses, but I remained
firm throughout luncheon. Finally, at the end of
luncheon I capitulated in a flood of tears and accepted the loan
of my mother’s gold pencil-case and scribbled <i>J’aime, tu aimes,
il aime</i>, etc., on a piece of writing-paper.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room we were not often naughty, but we
were sometimes, and tried the grown-ups at moments beyond
endurance. My mother said that she had had to whip us all
except Hugo. I was whipped three times. Before the operation
my mother always took off her rings.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Margaret and Elizabeth used sometimes to fight,
and Susan would join in the fray, inspired by the impulse of the
moment. She was liable to these sudden impulses, and on one
occasion—she was very small—when she was looking on at a
review of volunteers, when the guns suddenly fired, she stood
up in the carriage and boxed everyone’s ears.</p>

<p>Not long ago we found an old mark-book which belonged
to this epoch of schoolroom life, and in it was the following
entry in Chérie’s handwriting: “Elizabeth et Marguerite se
sont battues, Suzanne s’est jetée sur le pauvre petit Maurice.”
Whenever Margaret saw that I was on the verge of tears she
used to say that I made a special face, which meant I was
getting ready to cry, and she called this <i>la première position</i>;
when the corners of the mouth went down, and the first
snuffle was heard, she called it <i>la seconde position</i>; and when
tears actually came, it was <i>la troisième position</i>. Nearly always
the mention of <i>la première position</i> averted tears altogether.</p>

<p>On Monday evenings in London my mother used to go
regularly to the Monday Pops at St. James’s Hall, and on Saturday
afternoon also. Dinner was at seven on Mondays, and
we used to go down to it, and watch my mother cut up a leg
of chicken and fill it with mustard and pepper and cayenne
pepper to make a devil for supper. Margaret was sometimes
taken to the Monday Pop, as she was supposed to like it, but
the others were seldom taken, in case, my mother used to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“You say when you are grown up that you were dragged to
concerts, and get to dislike them.” The result was a feverish
longing to go to the Monday Pop. I don’t remember going to
the Monday Pop until I was grown up, but I know that I
always wanted to go. I was taken to the Saturday Pop sometimes,
and the first one I went to was on 8th November 1879.
I was five years old. This was the programme:</p>

<p>Every winter we were taken to the pantomime by Lord
Antrim, and the pantomimes I remember seeing were <i>Mother
Goose</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, <i>Sinbad the Sailor</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>, and
<i>Cinderella</i>, in which the funny parts were played by Herbert
Campbell and Harry Nicholls, and the Princess sometimes by the
incomparably graceful dancer, Kate Vaughan.</p>

<p>I also remember the first Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
<i>Pinafore</i> I was too young for; but I saw the <i>Children’s Pinafore</i>,
which was played by children. <i>Patience</i> and <i>Iolanthe</i> and
<i>Princess Ida</i> I saw when they were first produced at the Savoy.</p>

<p>Irving and Ellen Terry we never saw till I went to school,
as Irving’s acting in Shakespeare made my father angry. When
he saw him play Romeo, he was heard to mutter the whole time:
“Remove that man from the stage.”</p>

<p>Then there were children’s parties. Strangely enough, I
only remember one of these, so I don’t expect I enjoyed them.
But I remember a children’s garden party at Marlborough
House, and the exquisite beauty, the grace, and the fairy-tale-like
welcome of the Princess of Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the great days for the children in London were
Valentine’s Day, on the eve of which we each of us sent the
whole of the rest of the family Valentines, cushioned and
scented Valentines with silken fringes; and the 1st of April,
when Susan was always made an April fool, the best one being
one of Chérie’s, who sent her to look in the schoolroom for
<i>Les Mémoires de Jonas dans la baleine</i>. She searched conscientiously,
but in vain, for this interesting book.</p>

<p>On one occasion, on the Prince of Wales’ wedding-day, in
March, the whole family were invited to a children’s ball at
Marlborough House. The girls’ frocks were a subject of daily
discussion for weeks beforehand, and other governesses used to
come and discuss the matter. They were white frocks, and
when they were ready they were found to be a failure, for some
reason, and they had to be made all over again at another
dressmaker’s, called Mrs. Mason. It was on this occasion that
Chérie made a memorable utterance and said: “Les pointes de
Madame Mason sont incomparables,” as Elizabeth had for the
first time risen to the dignity of a <i>pointe</i> (the end of the pointed
“bodies” of the fashions of that day). It was doubtful whether
the new frocks would be ready in time. There was a momentous
discussion as to whether they were to wear black stockings or
not. Finally the frocks arrived, and we were dressed and were
all marshalled downstairs ready to start. My father in knee-breeches
and myself in a black velvet suit, black velvet breeches,
and a white waistcoat. I was told to be careful to remember
to kiss the Princess of Wales’ hand.</p>

<p>I can just remember the ballroom, but none of the grown-up
people—nothing, in fact, except a vague crowd of tulle skirts.</p>

<p>One night there was a ball, or rather a small dance, in Charles
Street, and I was allowed to come down after going to bed all
day. People shook their heads over this, and said I was being
spoilt, to Chérie, but Chérie said: “Cet enfant n’est pas gâté
mais il se fait gâter.”</p>

<p>The dance led off with a quadrille, in which I and my father
both took part. After having carefully learnt the <i>pas chassé</i>
at dancing lessons, I was rather shocked to find this elegant
glide was not observed by the quadrille dancers.</p>

<p>All this was the delightful epoch of the ’eighties, when the
shop windows were full of photographs of the professional
beauties, and bands played tunes from the new Gilbert and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Sullivan in the early morning in the streets, and people rode
in Rotten Row in the evening, and Chérie used to rush us
across the road to get a glimpse of Mrs. Langtry or the
Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>Dancing lessons played an important part in our lives. Our
first dancing instructor was the famous ex-ballerina, Madame
Taglioni, a graceful old lady with grey curls, who held a class at
Lady Granville’s house in Carlton House Terrace. It was there
I had my first dancing lesson and learnt the Tarantelle, a dance
with a tambourine, which I have always found effective, if not
useful, in later life. Then Madame Taglioni’s class came to an
end, and there was a class at Lady Ashburton’s at Bath House,
which was suddenly put a stop to owing to the rough and wild
behaviour of the boys, myself among them. Finally we had a
class in our own house, supervised by a strict lady in black silk,
who taught us the <i>pas chassé</i>, the five positions, the valse, the
polka, and the Lancers.</p>

<p>Another event was Mrs. Christie’s lottery, which was held
once a year at her house at Kentish Town. All her pupils
came, and everyone won a prize in the lottery. One year I won
a stuffed duck. After tea we acted charades. On the way back
we used to pass several railway bridges, and Chérie, producing a
gold pencil, used to say: “Par la vertu de ma petite baguette,”
she would make a train pass. It was perhaps a rash boast, but
it was always successful.</p>

<p>We used to drive to Mrs. Christie’s in a coach, an enormous
carriage driven by Maisy, the coachman, who wore a white wig.
It was only used when the whole family had to be transported
somewhere.</p>

<p>Another incident of London life was Mademoiselle Ida’s
pupils’ concert, which happened in the summer. I performed
twice at it, I think, but never a solo. A duet with Mademoiselle
Ida playing the bass, and whispering: “Gare au dièse, gare au
bémol,” in my ear. What we enjoyed most about this was
waiting in what was called the artists’ room, and drinking
raspberry vinegar.</p>

<p>But the crowning bliss of London life was Hamilton Gardens,
where we used to meet other children and play flags in the
summer evenings.</p>

<p>This was the scene of wild enjoyment, not untinged with
romance, for there the future beauties of England were all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
play in their lovely teens. We were given tickets for concerts
at the Albert Hall and elsewhere in the afternoon, but I
remember that often when Hugo and I were given the choice
of going to a concert or playing in the nursery, we sometimes
chose to play. But I do remember hearing Patti sing “Coming
thro’ the Rye” at the Guildhall, and Albani and Santley on
several occasions.</p>

<p>But what we enjoyed most of all was finding some broken and
derelict toy, and inventing a special game for it. Once in a cupboard
in the back drawing-room I came across some old toys
which had belonged to John and Cecil, and must have been there
for years. Among other things there was an engine in perfectly
good repair, with a little cone like the end of a cigar which you
put inside the engine under the funnel. You then lit it and smoke
came out, and the engine moved automatically. This seemed
too miraculous for inquiry, and I still wonder how and why it
happened. Then the toy was unaccountably lost, and I never
discovered the secret of this mysterious and wonderful engine.</p>

<p>During all this time there were two worlds of which one
gradually became conscious: the inside world and the outside
world. The centre of the inside world, like the sun to the solar
system, was, of course, our father and mother (Papa and
Mamma), the dispenser of everything, the source of all enjoyment,
and the final court of appeal, recourse to which was often
threatened in disputes.</p>

<p>Next came Chérie, then my mother’s maid, Dimmock, then
Sheppy, the housekeeper, who had white grapes, cake, and other
treats in the housekeeper’s room. She was a fervent Salvationist
and wore a Salvationist bonnet, and when my father
got violent and shouted out loud ejaculations, she used to coo
softly in a deprecating tone.</p>

<p>Then there was Monsieur Butat, the cook, who used to appear
in white after breakfast when my father ordered dinner; Deacon,
his servant, was the source of all worldly wisdom and experience,
and recommended brown billycock hats in preference to
black ones, because they did not fade in the sea air; Harriet,
the housemaid, who used to bring a cup of tea in the early
morning to my mother’s bedroom, and Frank the footman.
I can’t remember a butler in London, but I suppose there was
one; but if it was the same one we had in the country, it was
Mr. Watson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Dimmock, or D., as we used to call her, played a great part
in my early life, because when I came up to London or went
down to the country alone with my father and mother she used
to have sole charge of me, and I slept in her room. One day,
during one of these autumnal visits to London, I was given an
umbrella with a skeleton’s head on it. This came back in
dreams to me with terrific effect, and for several nights running
I ran down from the top to the bottom of the house in terror.
The umbrella was taken away. I used to love these visits to
London when half the house was shut up, and there was no
one there except my father and mother and D., and we used to
live in the library downstairs. There used to be long and almost
daily expeditions to shops because Christmas was coming, as
D. used to chant to me every morning, and the Christmas-tree
shopping had to be done. D. and I used to buy all the materials
for the Christmas-tree—the candles, the glass balls, and the fairy
to stand at the top of it—in a shop in the Edgware Road called
Eagle. I used to have dinner in the housekeeper’s room with
Sheppy, and spent most of my time in D.’s working-room. One
day she gave me a large piece of red plush, and I had something
sewn round it, and called it <i>Red Conscience</i>. Never did a present
make me more happy; I treated it as something half sacred, like
a Mussulman’s mat.</p>

<p>On one occasion D. and I went to a matinée at St. James’s
Theatre to see <i>A Scrap of Paper</i>, played by Mr. and Mrs.
Kendal. This year I read the play (it was translated from
Sardou’s <i>Pattes de Mouche</i>) for the first time, and I found I
could recollect every scene of the play, and Mrs. Kendal’s
expression and intonation.</p>

<p>Another time Madame Neruda, who was a great friend of my
mother’s, whom we saw constantly, gave me two tickets for a
ballad concert at which she was playing. The policeman was
told to take me into the artists’ room during the interval.
D. was to take me, but for some reason she thought the concert
was in the evening, and it turned out to be in the afternoon;
so as a compensation my father sent us to an operetta called
<i>Falka</i>, in which Miss Violet Cameron sang. I enjoyed it more
than any concert. The next day Madame Neruda came to
luncheon and heard all about the misadventure. “And did
you enjoy your operetta?” she asked. “Yes,” I said, with
enthusiasm. “Say, not as much as you would have enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the ballad concert,” said my mother. But I didn’t feel so sure
about that.</p>

<p>I used to do lessons with Mrs. Christie, and have music
lessons from Mademoiselle Ida, and in the afternoon I often
used to go out shopping in the carriage with my mother, or
for a walk with D. But I will tell more about her later when
I describe Membland.</p>

<p>The girls had a maid who looked after them called Rawlinson,
and she and the nursery made up the rest of the inside
world in London.</p>

<p>In the outside world the first person of importance I remember
was Grandmamma, my mother’s mother, Lady Elizabeth
Bulteel, who used to paint exquisite pictures for the
children like the pictures on china, and play songs for us on the
pianoforte. She often came to luncheon, and used to bring toys
to be raffled for, and make us, at the end of luncheon, sing a song
which ran:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A pie sat on a pear tree,</div>
<div class="verse">And once so merrily hopped she,</div>
<div class="verse">And twice so merrily hopped she,</div>
<div class="verse">Three times so merrily hopped she,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Each singer held a glass in his hand. When the song had
got thus far, everyone drained their glass, and the person
who finished first had to say the last line of the verse, which
was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ya-he, ya-ho, ya-ho.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the person who said it first, won.</p>

<p>Everything about Grandmamma was soft and exquisite:
her touch on the piano and her delicate manipulation of
the painting-brush. She lived in Green Street, a house I remember
as the perfection of comfort and cultivated dignity.
There were amusing drawing-tables with tiles, pencils, painting-brushes;
chintz chairs and books and music; a smell of potpourri
and lavender water; miniatures in glass tables, pretty
china, and finished water-colours.</p>

<p>In November 1880—this is one of the few dates I can place—we
were in London, my father and mother and myself, and
Grandmamma was not well. She must have been over eighty, I
think. Every day I used to go to Green Street with my mother
and spend the whole morning illuminating a text. I was
told Grandmamma was very ill, and had to take the nastiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
medicines, and was being so good about it. I was sometimes
taken in to see her. One day I finished the text, and it was
given to Grandmamma. That evening when I was having my
tea, my father and mother came into the dining-room and told
me Grandmamma was dead. The text I had finished was
buried with her.</p>

<p>The next day at luncheon I asked my mother to sing “A
pie sat on a pear tree,” as usual. It was the daily ritual of
luncheon. She said she couldn’t do “Hopped she,” as we called
it, any longer now that Grandmamma was not there.</p>

<p>Another thing Grandmamma had always done at luncheon
was to break a thin water biscuit into two halves, so that one
half looked like a crescent moon; and I said to my mother,
“We shan’t be able to break biscuits like that any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">MEMBLAND</span></h2>

<p>To mention any of the other people of the outside world
at once brings me to Membland, because the outside
world was intimately connected with that place.
Membland was a large, square, Jacobean house, white brick,
green shutters and ivy, with some modern gabled rough-cast
additions and a tower, about twelve miles from Plymouth and
ten miles from the station Ivy Bridge.</p>

<p>On the north side of the house there was a gravel yard, on
the south side a long, sweeping, sloping lawn, then a ha-ha, a
field beyond this and rookery which was called the Grove.</p>

<p>When you went through the front hall you came into a large
billiard-room in which there was a staircase leading to a gallery
going round the room and to the bedrooms. The billiard-room
was high and there were no rooms over the billiard-room proper—but
beyond the billiard-table the room extended into a lower
section, culminating in a semicircle of windows in which there
was a large double writing-table.</p>

<p>Later, under the staircase, there was an organ, and the pipes
of the great organ were on the wall.</p>

<p>There was a drawing-room full of chintz chairs, books, potpourri,
a grand pianoforte, and two writing-tables; a dining-room
looking south; a floor of guests’ rooms; a bachelors’
passage in the wing; a schoolroom on the ground floor looking
north, with a little dark room full of rubbish next to it, which
was called the <i>Cabinet Noir</i>, and where we were sent when we
were naughty; and a nursery floor over the guests’ rooms.</p>

<p>From the northern side of the house you could see the hills
of Dartmoor. In the west there was a mass of tall trees, Scotch
firs, stone-pines, and ashes.</p>

<p>There was a large kitchen garden at some distance from
the house on a hill and enclosed by walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Our routine of life was much the same as it was in London,
except that the children had breakfast in the schoolroom at
nine, as the grown-ups did not have breakfast till later.</p>

<p>Then came lessons, a walk, or play in the garden, further
lessons, luncheon at two, a walk or an expedition, lessons from
five till six, and then tea and games or reading aloud afterwards.
One of the chief items of lessons was the <i>Dictée</i>, in which we all
took part, and even Everard from Eton used to come and join
in this sometimes.</p>

<p>Elizabeth won a kind of inglorious glory one day by making
thirteen mistakes in her <i>dictée</i>, which was the record—a record
never beaten by any one of us before or since; and the words
<i>treize fautes</i> used often to be hurled at her head in moments of
stress.</p>

<p>After tea Chérie used to read out books to the girls, and I
was allowed to listen, although I was supposed to be too young
to understand, and indeed I was. Nevertheless, I found the
experience thrilling; and there are many book incidents which
have remained for ever in my mind, absorbed during these
readings, although I cannot always place them. I recollect a
wonderful book called <i>L’Homme de Neige</i>, and many passages
from Alexandre Dumas.</p>

<p>Sometimes Chérie would read out to me, especially stories
from the <i>Cabinet des Fées</i>, or better still, tell stories of her own
invention. There was one story in which many animals took
part, and one of the characters was a partridge who used to go
out just before the shooting season with a telescope under his
wing to see whether things were safe. Chérie always used to
say this was the creation she was proudest of. Another story
was called <i>Le Prince Muguet et Princesse Myosotis</i>, which my
mother had printed. I wrote a different story on the same
theme and inspired by Chérie’s story when I grew up. But I
enjoyed Chérie’s recollections of her childhood as much as her
stories, and I could listen for ever to the tales of her <i>grand-mère
sévere</i> who made her pick thorny juniper to make gin, or the story
of a lady who had only one gown, a yellow one, and who every
day used to ask her maid what the weather was like, and if the
maid said it was fine, she would say, “Eh bien, je mettrai ma
robe jaune,” and if it was rainy she would likewise say, “Je
mettrai ma robe jaune.” Poor Chérie used to be made to repeat
this story and others like it in season and out of season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>She would describe Paris until I felt I knew every street,
and landscapes in Normandy and other parts of France. The
dream of my life was to go to Paris and see the Boulevards
and the Invalides and the Arc de Triomphe, and above all, the
Champs Elysées.</p>

<p>Chérie had also a repertory of French songs which she used
to teach us. One was the melancholy story of a little cabin-boy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Je ne suis qu’un petit mousse</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A bord d’un vaisseau royal,</div>
<div class="verse">Je vais partout où le vent me pousse,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nord ou midi cela m’est égale.</div>
<div class="verse">Car d’une mère et d’un père</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Je n’ai jamais connu l’amour.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another one, less pathetic but more sentimental, was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Pourquoi tous les jours, Madeleine,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Vas-tu au bord du ruisseau?</div>
<div class="verse">Ce n’est pas, car je l’espère,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Pour te regarder dans l’eau,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Mais si,’ répond Madeleine,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Baissant ses beaux yeux d’ébêne.</div>
<div class="verse">Je n’y vais pour autre raison.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I forget the rest, but it said that she looked into the stream
to see whether it was true, as people said, that she was beautiful—“pour
voir si gent ne ment pas”—and came back satisfied
that it was true.</p>

<p>But best of all I liked the ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“En revenant des noces j’étais si fatiguée</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Au bord d’un ruisseau je me suis reposée,</div>
<div class="verse">L’eau était si claire que je me suis baignée,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Avec une feuille de chêne je me suis essuyée,</div>
<div class="verse">Sur la plus haute branche un rossignol chantait,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Chante, beau rossignol, si tu as le cœur gai,</div>
<div class="verse">Pour un bouton de rose mon ami s’est fâché,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Je voudrais que la rose fût encore au rosier,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Besides these she taught us all the French singing games:
“Savez-vous planter les choux?” “Sur le pont d’Avignon,”
and “Qu’est qui passe ici si tard, Compagnons de la Marjolaine?”
We used to sing and dance these up and down the
passage outside the schoolroom after tea.</p>

<p>Round about Membland were several nests of relations. Six
miles off was my mother’s old home Flete, where the Mildmays
lived. Uncle Bingham Mildmay married my mother’s sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Aunt Georgie, and bought Flete; the house, which was old, was
said to be falling to pieces, so it was rebuilt, more or less on the
old lines, with some of the old structure left intact.</p>

<p>At Pamflete, three miles off, lived my mother’s brother,
Uncle Johnny Bulteel, with his wife, Aunt Effie, and thirteen
children.</p>

<p>And in the village of Yealmpton, three miles off, also lived
my great-aunt Jane who had a sister called Aunt Sister, who,
whenever she heard carriage wheels in the drive, used to get
under the bed, such was her disinclination to receive guests. I
cannot remember Aunt Sister, but I remember Aunt Jane and
Uncle Willie Harris, who was either her brother or her husband.
He had been present at the battle of Waterloo as a drummer-boy
at the age of fifteen. But Aunt Sister’s characteristics had
descended to other members of the family, and my mother used
to say that when she and her sister were girls my Aunt Georgie
had offered her a pound if she would receive some guests instead
of herself.</p>

<p>On Sundays we used to go to church at a little church in
Noss Mayo until my father built a new church, which is there
now.</p>

<p>The service was long, beginning at eleven and lasting till
almost one. There was morning prayer, the Litany, the Ante-Communion
service, and a long sermon preached by the rector,
a charming old man called Mr. Roe, who was not, I fear, a
compelling preacher.</p>

<p>When we went to church I was given a picture-book when
I was small to read during the sermon, a book with sacred
pictures in colours. I was terribly ashamed of this. I would
sooner have died than be seen in the pew with this book. It was
a large picture-book. So I used every Sunday to lose or hide it
just before the service, and find it again afterwards. On Sunday
evenings we used sometimes to sing hymns in the schoolroom.
The words of the hymns were a great puzzle. For instance, in
the hymn, “Thy will be done,” the following verse occurs—I
punctuate it as I understood it, reading it, that is to say,
according to the tune—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Renew my will from day to day,</div>
<div class="verse">Blend it with Thine, and take away.</div>
<div class="verse">All <i>that</i> now makes it hard to say</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thy will be done.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought the blending and the subsequent taking away of
what was blent was a kind of trial of faith.</p>

<p>After tea, instead of being read to, we used sometimes to play
a delightful round game with counters, called <i>Le Nain Jaune</i>.</p>

<p>Any number of people could play at it, and I especially
remember Susan triumphantly playing the winning card and
saying:</p>

<p>“Le bon Valet, la bonne Dame, le bon Woi. Je wecommence.”</p>

<p>In September or October, Chérie would go for her holidays.
I cannot remember if she went every year, but we had no one
instead of her, and she left behind her a series of holiday tasks.</p>

<p>During one of her absences my Aunt M’aimée, another
sister of my mother’s, came to stay with us. Aunt M’aimée
was married to Uncle Henry Ponsonby, the Queen’s Private
Secretary. He came, too, and with them their daughter Betty.
Betty had a craze at that time for Sarah Bernhardt, and gave a
fine imitation of her as Doña Sol in the last act of <i>Hernani</i>.
It was decided we should act this whole scene, with Margaret
as Hernani and Aunt M’aimée reading the part of Ruy Gomez,
who appears in a domino and mask.</p>

<p>Never had I experienced anything more thrilling. I used to
lie on the floor during the rehearsals, and soon I knew the whole
act by heart. I thought Betty the greatest genius that ever
lived.</p>

<p>When Chérie came back she was rather surprised and not
altogether pleased to find I knew the whole of the last act of
<i>Hernani</i> by heart. She thought this a little too exciting and
grown-up for me, and even for Margaret, but none the less
she let me perform the part of Doña Sol one evening after tea in
my mother’s bedroom, dressed in a white frock, with Susan in a
riding-habit playing the sinister figure of Ruy Gomez. I can
see Chérie now, sitting behind a screen, book in hand to prompt
me, and shaking with laughter as I piped out in a tremulous and
lisping treble the passionate words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Il vaudrait mieuxzaller (which I made all one word) au tigre même</div>
<div class="verse">Arracher ses petits qu’à moi celui que j’aime.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Chérie’s return from her holidays was one of the most
exciting of events, for she would bring back with her a mass of
toys from Giroux and the <i>Paradis des Enfants</i>, and a flood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stories about the people and places and plays she had seen, and
the food she had eaten.</p>

<p>One year she brought me back a theatre of puppets. It
was called Théâtre français. It had a white proscenium, three
scenes and an interior, a Moorish garden by moonlight, and a
forest, and a quantity of small puppets suspended by stiff wires
and dressed in silk and satin. There was a harlequin, a columbine,
a king, a queen, many princesses, a villain scowling beneath
black eyebrows, an executioner with a mask, peasants, pastry-cooks,
and soldiers with halberds, who would have done honour
to the Papal Guard at the Vatican, and some heavily moustached
gendarmes. This theatre was a source of ecstasy, and innumerable
dramas used to be performed in it. Chérie used also to
bring back some delicious cakes called <i>nonnettes</i>, a kind of gingerbread
with icing on the top, rolled up in a long paper cylinder.</p>

<p>She also brought baskets of bonbons from Boissier, the kind
of basket which had several floors of different kinds of bonbons,
fondants on the top in their white frills, then caramels, then
chocolates, then fruits confits. All these things confirmed one’s
idea that there could be no place like Paris.</p>

<p>In 1878, when I was four years old, another brother was born,
Rupert, in August, but he died in October of the same year.
He was buried in Revelstoke Church, a church not used any
more, and then in ruins except for one aisle, which was roofed
in, and provided with pews. It nestled by the seashore, right
down on the rocks, grey and covered with ivy, and surrounded
by quaint tombstones that seemed to have been scattered
haphazard in the thick grass and the nettles.</p>

<p>I think it was about the same time that one evening I was
playing in my godmother’s room, that I fell into the fire, and
my little white frock was ablaze and my back badly burnt.
I remember being taken up to the nursery and having my
back rubbed with potatoes, and thinking that part, and the
excitement and sympathy shown, and the interest created,
great fun.</p>

<p>All this was before Hugo was in the schoolroom, but in all my
sharper memories of Membland days he plays a prominent
part. We, of course, shared the night nursery, and we soon
invented games together, some of which were distracting, not
to say maddening, to grown-up people. One was an imaginary
language in which even the word “Yes” was a trisyllable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
namely: “Sheepartee,” and the word for “No” was even longer
and more complicated, namely: “Quiliquinino.” We used to
talk this language, which was called “Sheepartee,” and which
consisted of unmitigated gibberish, for hours in the nursery,
till Hilly, Grace, and Annie could bear it no longer, and Everard
came up one evening and told us the language must stop or we
should be whipped.</p>

<p>The language stopped, but a game grew out of it, which was
most complicated, and lasted for years even after we went to
school. The game was called “Spankaboo.” It consisted of
telling and acting the story of an imaginary continent in which
we knew the countries, the towns, the government, and the
leading people. These countries were generally at war with one
another. Lady Spankaboo was a prominent lady at the Court
of Doodahn. She was a charming character, not beautiful nor
clever, and sometimes a little bit foolish, but most good-natured
and easily taken in. Her husband, Lord Spankaboo, was a
country gentleman, and they had no children. She wore red
velvet in the evening, and she was <i>bien vue</i> at Court.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of characters in the game. They increased
as the story grew. It could be played out of doors,
where all the larger trees in the garden were forts belonging to the
various countries, or indoors, but it was chiefly played in the
garden, or after we went to bed. Then Hugo would say: “Let’s
play Spankaboo,” and I would go straight on with the latest
events, interrupting the narrative every now and then by saying:
“Now, you be Lady Spankaboo,” or whoever the character on
the stage might be for the moment, “and I’ll be So-and-so.”
Everything that happened to us and everything we read was
brought into the game—history, geography, the ancient Romans,
the Greeks, the French; but it was a realistic game, and there
were no fairies in it and nothing in the least frightening. As
it was a night game, this was just as well.</p>

<p>Hugo was big for his age, with powerful lungs, and after
luncheon he used to sing a song called “Apples no more,” with
immense effect. Hugo was once told the following riddle:
“Why can’t an engine-driver sit down?”—to which the answer
is, “Because he has a tender behind.” He asked this to my
mother at luncheon the next day, and when nobody could guess
it, he said: “Because he has a soft behind.” There was a
groom in the stables who had rather a Japanese cast of face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and we used to call him <i>le Japonnais.</i> One day Hugo went
and stood in front of him and said to him: “You’re the
Japonais.” On another occasion when Hugo was learning to
conjugate the auxiliary verb <i>être</i>, Chérie urged him to add a
substantive after “Je suis,” to show he knew what he was
doing. “Je suis une plume,” said Hugo.</p>

<p>We were constantly in D.’s room and used to play sad tricks
on her. She rashly told us one day that her brother Jim had
once taken her to a fair at Wallington and had there shown her
a Punch’s face, in gutta-percha, on the wall. “Go and touch
his nose,” had said Jim. She did so, and the face being charged
with electricity gave her a shock.</p>

<p>This story fired our imagination and we resolved to follow
Jim’s example. We got a galvanic battery, how and where, I
forget, the kind which consists of a small box with a large
magnet in it, and a handle which you turn, the patient holding
two small cylinders. We persuaded D. to hold the cylinders,
and then we made the current as strong as possible and turned
the handle with all our might. Poor D. screamed and tears
poured down her cheeks, but we did not stop, and she could
not leave go because the current contracts the fingers; we went
on and on till she was rescued by someone else.</p>

<p>Another person we used to play tricks on was M. Butat, the
cook, and one day Hugo and I, to his great indignation, threw a
dirty mop into his stock-pot.</p>

<p>A great ally in the house was the housekeeper, Mrs. Tudgay.
Every day at eleven she would have two little baskets ready for
us, which contained biscuits, raisins and almonds, two little
cakes, and perhaps a tangerine orange.</p>

<p>To the outside world Mrs. Tudgay was rather alarming.
She had a calm, crystal, cold manner; she was thin, reserved,
rather sallow, and had a clear, quiet, precise way of saying
scathing and deadly things to those whom she disliked. Once
when Elizabeth was grown up and married and happened to be
staying with us, Mrs. Tudgay said to her: “You’re an expense
to his Lordship.” Once when she engaged an under-housemaid
she said: “She shall be called—nothing—and get £15 a year.”
But for children she had no terrors. She was devoted to us,
bore anything, did anything, and guarded our effects and
belongings with the vigilance of a sleepless hound. She had
formerly been maid to the Duchess of San Marino in Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and she had a fund of stories about Italy, a scrap-book full
of Italian pictures and photographs, and a silver cross containing
a relic of the True Cross given her by Pope Pius <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span>
We very often spent the evening in the housekeeper’s room,
and played Long Whist with Mrs. Tudgay, D., Mr. Deacon, and
John’s servant, Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>When, in the morning, we were exhausted from playing
forts and Spankaboo in the garden, we used to leap through
Mrs. Tudgay’s window into the housekeeper’s room, which was
on the ground floor and looked out on to the garden, and demand
refreshment, and Mrs. Tudgay used to bring two wine glasses of
ginger wine and some biscuits.</p>

<p>Sometimes we used to go for picnics with Mrs. Tudgay, D.,
Hilly, and the other servants. We started out in the morning
and took luncheon with us, which was eaten at one of the many
keepers’ houses on the coast, some of which had a room kept for
expeditions, and then spent the afternoon paddling on the
rocks and picking shells and anemones. We never bathed, as
there was not a single beach on my father’s estate where it was
possible. It was far too rocky. Mrs. Tudgay had a small and
ineffectual Pomeranian black dog called Albo, who used to be
taken on these expeditions. Looking back on these, I wonder
at the quantity of food D. and Mrs. Tudgay used to allow us to
eat. Hugo and I thought nothing of eating a whole lobster
apiece, besides cold beef and apple tart.</p>

<p>Sometimes we all went expeditions with my mother. Then
there used to be sketching, and certainly more moderation in
the way of food.</p>

<p>Membland was close to the sea. My father made a ten-mile
drive along the cliffs so that you could drive from the
house one way, make a complete circle, and come back following
the seacoast all the way to the river Yealm, on one side of
which was the village of Newton Ferrers and on the other the
village of Noss Mayo. Both villages straggled down the slopes
of a steep hill. Noss Mayo had many white-washed and straw-thatched
cottages and some new cottages of Devonshire stone
built by my father, with slate roofs, but not ugly or aggressive.
Down the slopes of Noss there were fields and orchards, and here
and there a straw-thatched cottage. They were both fishing
villages, the Yealm lying beneath them, a muddy stretch at
low tide and a brimming river at high tide. Newton had an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
grey Devonshire church with a tower at the west end. At Noss
my father built a church exactly the same in pattern of Devonshire
stone. You could not have wished for a prettier village
than Noss, and it had, as my mother used to say: “a little
foreign look about it.”</p>

<p>At different points of this long road round the cliffs, which
in the summer were a blaze of yellow gorse, there were various
keepers’ cottages, as I have said. From one you looked straight
on to the sea from the top of the cliff. Another was hidden low
down among orchards and not far from the old ruined church
of Revelstoke. A third, called Battery Cottage, was built near
the emplacement of an old battery and looked out on to the
Mewstone towards Plymouth Sound and Ram Head. The
making of this road and the building of the church were two
great events. Pieces of the cliff had to be blasted with dynamite,
which was under the direction of a cheery workman called Mr.
Yapsley, during the road-making, and the building of the
church which was in the hands of Mr. Crosbie, the Clerk of the
Works, whom we were devoted to, entailed a host of interesting
side-issues. One of these was the carving which was done by
Mr. Harry Hems of Exeter. He carved the bench-ends, and on
one of them was a sea battle in which a member of the Bulteel
family, whom we took to be Uncle Johnny, was seen hurling a
stone from a mast’s crows’ nest in a sailing ship, on to a serpent
which writhed in the waves. Hugo and I both sat for cherubs’
heads, which were carved in stone on the reredos. There were
some stained-glass windows and a hand-blown organ on which
John used to play on Sundays when it was ready.</p>

<p>The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter,
Bishop Temple.</p>

<p>Hugo and I learned to ride first on a docile beast called
Emma, who, when she became too lethargic, was relegated to a
little cart which used to be driven by all of us, and then on a
Dartmoor pony called the Giant, and finally on a pony called
Emma Jane.</p>

<p>The coachman’s name was Bilky. He was a perfect Devonshire
character. His admiration for my brothers was unbounded.
He used to talk of them one after the other, afraid
if he had praised one, he had not praised the others enough.
My brother Everard, whom we always called the “Imp,” he said
was as strong as a lion and as nimble as a bee. “They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rightly, sir, named you the Himp,” one of the servants said to
him one day.</p>

<p>During all these years we had extraordinarily few illnesses.
Hugo once had whooping-cough at London, and I was put in the
same room so as to have it at the same time, and although I was
longing to catch it, as Hugo was rioting in presents and delicacies
as well as whoops, my constitution was obstinately impervious
to infection.</p>

<p>We often had colds, entailing doses of spirits of nitre, linseed
poultices, and sometimes even a mustard poultice, but I never
remember anything more serious. Every now and then Hilly
thought it necessary to dose us with castor-oil, and the struggles
that took place when Hilly used to arrive with a large spoon,
saying, as every Nanny I have ever known says: “Now, take
it!” were indescribable. I recollect five people being necessary
one day to hold me down before the castor-oil could be got
down my throat. We had a charming comfortable country
doctor called Doctor Atkins, who used to drive over in a dog-cart,
muffled in wraps, and produce a stethoscope out of his hat.
He was so genial and comfortable that one began to feel better
directly he felt one’s pulse.</p>

<p>When we first went to Membland the post used to be brought
by a postman who walked every day on foot from Ivy Bridge,
ten miles off. He had a watch the size of a turnip, and the
stamps at that time were the dark red ones with the Queen’s
head on them. Later the post came in a cart from Plympton,
and finally from Plymouth.</p>

<p>In the autumn, visitors used to begin to arrive for the
covert shooting, which was good and picturesque, the pheasants
flying high in the steep woods on the banks of the Yealm, and
during the autumn months the nearing approach of Christmas
cast an aura of excitement over life. The first question was:
Would there be a Christmas tree? During all the early years
there was one regularly.</p>

<p>After the November interval in London, which I have
already described, the serious business of getting the tree
ready began. It was a large tree, and stood in a square
green box.</p>

<p>The first I remember was placed in the drawing-room, the
next in the dining-room, the next in the billiard-room, and
after that they were always in the covered-in tennis court, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had been built in the meanwhile. The decoration of the tree was
under the management of D. The excitement when the tree
was brought into the house or the tennis court for the first time
was terrific, and Mr. Ellis, the house-carpenter, who always wore
carpet shoes, climbed up a ladder and affixed the silver fairy to
the top of the tree. Then reels of wire were brought out, scissors,
boxes of crackers, boxes of coloured candles, glass-balls, clips for
candles, and a quantity of little toys.</p>

<p>Hugo and I were not allowed to do much. Nearly everything
we did was said to be wrong. The presents were, of course,
kept a secret and were done up in parcels, and not brought into
the room until the afternoon of Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>The Christmas tree was lit on Christmas Eve after tea. The
ritual was always the same. Hugo and I ran backwards and
forwards with the servants’ presents. The maids were given
theirs first,—they consisted of stuff for a gown done up in a parcel,—then
Mrs. Tudgay, D., and the upper servants. One year Mrs.
Tudgay had a work-basket.</p>

<p>Then the guests were given their presents, and we gave our
presents and received our own. The presents we gave were
things we had made ourselves: kettle-holders, leather slippers
worked in silk for my father, and the girls sometimes made a
woollen waistcoat or a comforter. Chérie always had a nice
present for my mother, which we were allowed to see beforehand,
and she always used to say: “N’y touchez pas, la fraîcheur en
fait la beauté.”</p>

<p>Our presents were what we had put down beforehand in a
list of “Christmas Wants”—a horse and cart, a painting-box, or
a stylograph pen.</p>

<p>The house used to be full at Christmas. My father’s
brothers, Uncle Tom and Uncle Bob, used to be there. Madame
Neruda I remember as a Christmas visitor. Godfrey Webb
wrote the following lines about Christmas at Membland:</p>

<p>Mr. Webb was a great feature in the children’s life of many
families. With his beady, bird-like eye and his impassive face
he made jokes so quietly that you overheard them rather than
heard them. One day out shooting on a steep hill in Newton
Wood, in which there were woodcock and dangerous shots, my
father said to him, “You take the middle drive, Godfrey; it’s
safer, <i>medio tutissimus</i>.” “Is there any chance of an <i>Ibis</i>?”
Mr. Webb asked quietly. Another time, he went out duck-shooting.
He was asked afterwards whether he had shot many.
“Not even a <i>Mallard imaginaire</i>,” was his answer.</p>

<p>Another Christmas event was the French play we used to
act under the stage management of Chérie.</p>

<p>When I was six I played the part of an old man with
a bald forehead and white tufts of hair in a play called <i>Le
Maître d’Ecole</i>, and I remember playing the part of Nicole
in scenes from the <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i> at Christmas in
1883, and an old witch called Mathurine in a play called
<i>Le Talisman</i> in January 1884.</p>

<p>One of our most ambitious efforts was a play called <i>La Grammaire</i>,
by Labiche: it proved too ambitious, and never got
further than a dress rehearsal in the schoolroom. In this play,
Elizabeth had the part of the heroine, and had to be elegantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dressed; she borrowed a grown-up gown, and had her hair
done up, but she took such a long time preening herself that she
missed her cue, which was: “L’ange la voici!” It was spoken
by Margaret, who had a man’s part.</p>

<p>“L’ange la voici!” said Margaret in ringing tones, but no
<i>ange</i> appeared. “L’ange la voici!” repeated Margaret, with
still greater emphasis, but still no <i>ange</i>; finally, not without
malice, Margaret almost shouted, “L’ange la voici!” and at
last Elizabeth tripped blushing on to the stage with the final
touches of her toilette still a little uncertain. In the same play,
Susan played the part of a red-nosed horse-coper, dressed in a
grey-tailed coat, called <i>Machut</i>.</p>

<p>Another source of joy in Membland life was the yacht, the
<i>Waterwitch</i>, which in the summer months used to sail as soon as
the Cowes Regatta was over, down to the Yealm River. The
<i>Waterwitch</i> was a schooner of 150 tons; it had one large cabin
where one had one’s meals, my mother’s cabin aft, a cabin for
my father, and three spare cabins. The name of the first captain
was Goomes, but he was afterwards replaced by Bletchington.
Goomes was employed later by the German Emperor. He had
a knack of always getting into rows during races, and even on
other occasions.</p>

<p>One day there was a regatta going on on the Yealm River;
the gig of the <i>Waterwitch</i> was to race the gig of another yacht.
They had to go round a buoy. For some reason, I was in the
<i>Waterwitch’s</i> gig when the race started, sitting in the stern next
to Goomes, who was steering. All went well at first, but when the
boats were going round the buoy they fouled, and Goomes and
the skipper of the rival gig were soon engaged in a hand-to-hand
combat, and beating each other hard with the steering-lines. My
father and the rest of the family were watching the race on
board the yacht. I think I was about six or seven. My father
shouted at the top of his voice, “Come back, come back,” but
to no avail, as Goomes and the other skipper were fighting like
two dogs, and the boats were almost capsizing. I think Goomes
won the fight and the race. I remember enjoying it all heartily,
but not so my father on board the yacht.</p>

<p>Bletchington was a much milder person and, besides being a
beautiful sailor, one of the gentlest and most beautiful-mannered
mariners I have ever met. He was invariably optimistic, and
always said there was a nice breeze. This sometimes tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the girls, who were bad sailors, to go out sailing, but they always
regretted it and used to come back saying, “How foolish we
were to be taken in!” Hugo and I were good sailors and enjoyed
the yacht more than anything. John was an expert in the
handling of a yacht, but the “Imp” nearly died of sea-sickness
if ever he ventured on board.</p>

<p>Captain Bletchington taught Hugo and myself a song in
Fiji language. It ran like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tang a rang a chicky nee, picky-nicky wooa,</div>
<div class="verse">Tarra iddy ucky chucky chingo.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which meant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“All up and down the river they did go;</div>
<div class="verse">The King and Queen of Otahiti.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I think what we enjoyed most of all were games of Hide-and-seek
on board. One day one of the sailors hid us by
reefing us up in a sail in the sail-room, a hiding-place which
baffled everyone. The <i>Waterwitch</i> was a fast vessel, and won
the schooners’ race round the Isle of Wight one year and only
narrowly missed winning the Queen’s Cup. The story of this
race used to be told us over and over again by D., and used to be
enacted by Hugo and me on our toy yachts or with pieces of
cork in the sink. This is what happened. Another schooner,
the <i>Cetonia</i>, had to allow the <i>Waterwitch</i> five minutes, but the
<i>Waterwitch</i> had to allow the <i>Sleuthhound</i>, a cutter, twenty-five
minutes. D. was watching from the shore, and my mother was
watching from the R.Y.S. Club. The <i>Cetonia</i> came in first,
but a minute or two later the <i>Waterwitch</i> sailed in before the
five minutes’ allowance was up. Then twenty minutes of
dreadful suspense rolled by, twenty-three minutes, and during
the last two minutes, as D. dramatically said, “That ’orrid
<i>Sleuthhound</i> sailed round the corner and won the race.” Hugo
and I felt we could never forgive the owner of the <i>Sleuthhound</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Waterwitch</i> there was a little steam launch called
the <i>Wasp</i> which used to take us in to Plymouth, and John had a
sailing-boat of his own.</p>

<p>In the summer holidays of 1883 Mr. Warre came to stay
with us. John, Cecil, and Everard were at his house at
Eton. Cecil was to read with him during the holidays.
Cecil was far the cleverest one of the family and a classical
scholar.</p>

<p>Mr. Warre was pleased to find I was interested in the stories
of the Greek heroes, but pained because I only knew their names
in French, speaking of Thesée, Medée, and Egée. The truth
being that I did not know how to pronounce their names in
English, as I had learnt all about them from Chérie. Chérie
said that Mr. Warre had “une tête bien equilibrée.” We performed
<i>Les Enfants d’Édouard</i> before him.</p>

<p>The following Christmas, Mr. Warre sent Hugo a magnificent
book illustrating the song “Apples no more,” with water-colour
drawings done by his daughter; and he sent me Church’s <i>Stories
from Homer</i>, with this Latin inscription at the beginning of it:</p>

<p class="center">MAURICIO BARING<br />
<span class="smcap">Jam ab ineunte aetate<br />
Veterum fautori<br />
antiquitatis studioso<br />
Maeonii carminis argumenta<br />
Anglice enucleata<br />
Streniâ propitiâ<br />
mittit</span><br />
EDMUNDUS WARRE<br />
<span class="smcap">Kal. Jan.<br />
mdccclxxxiii.</span></p>

<p>Nobody in the house knew what the Latin word <i>streniâ</i>
meant, not even Walter Durnford, who was then an Eton
master and destined to be the house tutor of Hugo and myself
later. But Chérie at once said it meant the feast of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Year. The scholars were puzzled and could not conceive how
she had known this. The French word <i>étrennes</i> had given her
the clue.</p>

<p>The whole of my childhood was a succession of crazes for
one thing after another: the first one, before I was three, was a
craze for swans, then came trains, then chess, then carpentry,
then organs and organ-building. My mother played chess, and
directly I learnt the game I used to make all the visitors play with
me. My mother used to say that she had once bet my Aunt
Effie she would beat her twenty-one games running, giving her a
pawn every time. She won twenty games and was winning the
twenty-first, late one night after dinner, when my father said
they had played long enough, and must go to bed, which of
course they refused to do. He then upset the board, and my
mother said she had never been so angry in her life; she had
bent back his little finger and had, she hoped, really hurt him.</p>

<p>I can remember playing chess and beating Admiral Glyn,
who came over from Plymouth. His ship was the <i>Agincourt</i>,
a large four-funnelled ironclad. One day we had luncheon on
board, and my father was chaffed for an unforgettable solecism,
namely, for having smoked on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Another craze was history. Chérie gave the girls a most
interesting historical task, which was called doing <i>Le Siècle de
Péricles</i> and <i>Le Siècle de Louis XIV.</i>, or whose-ever the century
might be.</p>

<p>You wrote on one side of a copy-book the chief events and
dates of the century in question, and on the other side short
biographies of the famous men who adorned it, with comments
on their deeds or works. I implored to be allowed to do this,
and in a large sprawling handwriting I struggled with <i>Le Siècle
de Péricles</i>, making up for my want of penmanship by the
passionate admiration I felt for the great men of the past. My
<i>History of the World</i> was the opposite to that of Mr. H. G. Wells!</p>

<p>Somebody gave me an American <i>History of the World</i>, a
large flat book which told the histories of all the countries of
the world in the form of a pictured chart, the countries being
represented by long, narrow belts or strips, so that you could
follow the destinies of the various Empires running parallel
to each other and see the smaller countries being absorbed by
the greater. The whole book was printed on a long, large,
glazed linen sheet, which you could pull out all at one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
if you had a room long enough and an unencumbered door.
You could also turn over the doubly folded leaves. That was
the more convenient way, although you did not get the full
effect. This book was a mine of interest. It had pictures of
every kind of side-issue and by-event, such as the Seven
Wonders of the World, the Coliseum, pictures of crusaders, and
portraits of famous men.</p>

<p>About the same time a friend of Cecil’s, Claud Lambton,
gave me an historical atlas which was also a great treat. Lessons
continued with Chérie, and I used to learn passages of Racine
(“Le Récit de Theramène”) and of Boileau (“La Mollesse,” from
the <i>Lutrin</i>) by heart, and “Les Imprécations de Camille.” I also
read a good deal by myself, but mostly fairy-tales, although
there were one or two grown-up books I read and liked. The
book I remember liking best of all was a novel called <i>Too Strange
not to be True</i>, by Lady Georgiana Fullerton, which my mother
read out to my cousin, Bessie Bulteel. I thought this a wonderful
book; I painted illustrations for it, making a picture of
every character.</p>

<p>There was another book which I read to myself and liked, if
anything, still better. I found it in Everard’s bedroom. It was
a yellow-backed novel, and it had on the cover the picture of
a dwarf letting off a pistol. It was called the <i>Siege of Castle
Something</i> and it was by—that is the question, who was it by?
I would give anything to know. The name of the author
seemed to me at the time quite familiar, that is to say, a name
one had heard people talk about, like Trollope or Whyte-Melville.
The story was that of an impecunious family who
led a gay life in London at a suburban house called the Robber’s
Cave, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. They were
always in debt, and finally, to escape bailiffs, they shut themselves
up in a castle on the seacoast, where they were safe
unless a bailiff should succeed in entering the house, and present
the writ to one of the debtors in person. The bailiffs tried every
expedient to force a way into the castle, one of them dressing
up as an old dowager who was a friend of the family, and driving
up to the castle in a custard-coloured carriage. But the inmates
of the house were wily, and they had a mechanical device by
which coloured billiard balls appeared on the frieze of the
drawing-room and warned them when a bailiff was in the offing.</p>

<p>One day when they had a visitor to tea, a billiard ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
suddenly made a clicking noise round the frieze. “What is
that for?” asked the interested guest. “That,” said the
host, with great presence of mind, “is a signal that a ship is
in sight.” As tea went on, a perfect plethora of billiard balls
of different colours appeared in the frieze. “There must be
a great many ships in sight to-day,” said the guest. “A great
many,” answered the host.</p>

<p>Whether a bailiff ever got into the house I don’t know. The
picture on the cover seems to indicate that he did. The book
was in Everard’s cupboard for years, and then, “suddenly,
as rare things will, it vanished.” I never have been able to find
it again, although I have never stopped looking for it. Once
I thought I had run it to earth. I once met at the Vice-Provost’s
house at Eton a man who was an expert lion-hunter and who
seemed to have read every English novel that had ever been
published. I described him the book. He had read it. He
remembered the picture on the cover and the story, but, alas!
he could recall neither its name nor that of the author.</p>

<p>In French <i>Les Malheurs de Sophie</i>, <i>Les Mémoires d’un Âne</i>,
<i>Sans Famille</i>, were the first early favourites, and then the
numerous illustrated works of Jules Verne.</p>

<p>Walter Scott’s novels used to be held before us like an
alluring bait. “When you are nine years old you shall read
<i>The Talisman</i>.” Even the order in which Scott was to be read
was discussed. <i>The Talisman</i> first, and then <i>Ivanhoe</i>, and then
<i>Quentin Durward</i>, <i>Woodstock</i> and <i>Kenilworth</i>, <i>Rob Roy</i> and <i>Guy
Mannering</i>.</p>

<p>The reading of the Waverley Novels was a divine, far-off
event, to which all one’s life seemed to be slowly moving, and
as soon as I was nine my mother read out <i>The Talisman</i> to me.
The girls had read all Walter Scott except, of course, <i>The Heart
of Midlothian</i>, which was not, as they said, for the J.P. (<i>jeune
personne</i>) and (but why not, I don’t know) <i>Peveril of the
Peak</i>. They also read Miss Yonge’s domestic epics. There I
never followed them, except for reading <i>The Little Duke</i>, <i>The
Lances of Lynwood</i>, and the historical romance of <i>The Chaplet
of Pearls</i>, which seemed to me thrilling.</p>

<p>I believe children absorb more <i>Kultur</i> from the stray grown-up
conversation they hear than they learn from books. At
luncheon one heard the grown-up people discussing books and
Chérie talking of new French novels. Not a word of all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
escaped my notice. I remember the excitement when <i>John
Inglesant</i> was published and Marion Crawford’s <i>Mr. Isaacs</i> and,
just before I went to school, <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>

<p>But besides the books of the day, one absorbed a mass of
tradition. My father had an inexhaustible memory, and he
would quote to himself when he was in the train, and at any
moment of stress and emotion a muttered quotation would
rise to his lips, often of the most incongruous kind. Sometimes
it was a snatch of a hymn of Heber’s, sometimes a lyric
of Byron’s, sometimes an epitaph of Pope’s, some lines of
Dryden or Churchill, or a bit of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>One little poem he was fond of quoting was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Mrs. Gill is very ill</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And nothing can improve her,</div>
<div class="verse">Unless she sees the Tuileries</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And waddles round the Louvre.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I believe it is by Hook.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I remember one twilight at the
end of a long train journey, when Papa, muffled in a large ulster,
kept on saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“False, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</div>
<div class="verse">That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and then Byron’s “I saw thee weep,” and when it came to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It could not match the living rays that filled that glance of thine,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">there were tears in his eyes. Then after a pause he broke into
Cowper’s hymn, “Hark my soul,” and I heard him whispering:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Can a woman’s tender care</div>
<div class="verse">Cease towards the child she bare?</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, she may forgetful be,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet will I remember thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But besides quotations from the poets he knew innumerable
tags, epitaphs, epigrams, which used to come out on occasions:
Sidney Smith’s receipt for a salad; Miss Fanshawe’s riddle,
“’Twas whispered in heaven, ’twas muttered in hell”; and
many other poems of this nature.</p>

<p>My father spoke French and German and Spanish. He
knew many of Schiller’s poems by heart. Soon after he was
married, he bet my mother a hundred pounds that she would
not learn Schiller’s poem “Die Glocke” by heart. My mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
did not know German. The feat was accomplished, but the
question was how was he to be got to hear her repeat the poem,
for, whenever she began he merely groaned and said, “Don’t,
don’t.” One day they were in Paris and had to drive somewhere,
a long drive into the suburbs which was to take an
hour or more, and my mother began, “Fest gemauert in der
Erde,” and nothing would stop her till she came to the end.
She won her hundred pounds. And when my father’s silver
wedding came about, in 1886, he was given a silver bell with
some lines of the “Glocke” inscribed on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Christie was decidedly of the opinion that we ought to
learn German, and so were my father and mother, but German
so soon after the Franco-Prussian War was a sore subject in the
house owing to Chérie, who cried when the idea of learning
German was broached, and I remember one day hearing my
mother tell Mrs. Christie that she simply couldn’t do it. So
much did I sympathise with Chérie that I tore out a picture of
Bismarck from a handsome illustrated volume dealing with
the Franco-Prussian War—an act of sympathy that Chérie
never forgot. So my father and mother sadly resigned themselves,
and it was settled we were not to learn German. I heard
a great deal about German poetry all the same, and one of
the outstanding points in the treasury of traditions that I
amassed from listening to what my father and mother said
was that Goethe was a great poet. I knew the story of <i>Faust</i>
from a large illustrated edition of that work which used to lie
about at Coombe.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most clearly defined of all the traditions
that we absorbed were those relating to the actors and the
singers of the past, especially to the singers. My father was
no great idolater of the past in the matter of acting, and he
told me once that he imagined Macready and the actors of his
time to have been ranters.</p>

<p>It was French acting he preferred—the art of Got, Delaunay,
and Coquelin—although Fechter was spoken of with enthusiasm,
and many of the English comedians, the Wigans, Mrs.
Keeley, Sam Sothern, Buckstone. The Bancrofts and Hare
and Mrs. Kendal he admired enormously, and Toole made him
shake with laughter.</p>

<p>At a play he either groaned if he disliked the acting or shook
with laughter if amused, or cried if he was moved. Irving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
made him groan as Romeo or Benedick, but he admired him in
melodrama and character parts, and as Shylock, while Ellen
Terry melted him, and when he saw her play <i>Macbeth</i>, he kept
on murmuring, “The dear little child.” But it was the musical
traditions which were the more important—the old days of
Italian Opera, the last days of the <i>bel canto</i>—Mario and Grisi
and, before them, Ronconi and Rubini and Tamburini.</p>

<p>My mother was never tired of telling of Grisi flinging herself
across the door in the <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, dressed in a parure
of turquoises, and Mario singing with her the duet in the
<i>Huguenots</i>. Mario, they used to say, was a <i>real</i> tenor, and had
the right <i>méthode</i>. None of the singers who came afterwards
was allowed to be a real tenor. Jean de Reszke was emphatically
not a real tenor. None of the German school had any
<i>méthode</i>. I suppose Caruso would have been thought a real
tenor, but I doubt if his <i>méthode</i> would have passed muster.
There was one singer who had no voice at all, but who was
immensely admired and venerated because of his <i>méthode</i>. I
think his name was Signor Brizzi. He was a singing-master,
and I remember saying that I preferred a singer who had just a
little voice.</p>

<p>My father loathed modern German Opera. Mozart, Donizetti,
Rossini, and Verdi enchanted him, and my mother, steeped in
classical music as she was, preferred Italian operas to all others.
Patti was given full marks both for voice and <i>méthode</i>, and
Trebelli, Albani, and Nilsson were greatly admired. But
Wagner was thought noisy, and <i>Faust</i> and <i>Carmen</i> alone of
more modern operas really tolerated.</p>

<p>Sometimes my mother would teach me the accompaniments
of the airs in Donizetti’s <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, while she played
on the concertina, and she used always to say: “Do try and
get the bass right.” The principle was, and I believe it to
be a sound one, that if the bass is right, the treble will take
care of itself. What she and my Aunt M’aimée called playing
with a <i>foolish</i> bass was as bad as driving a pony with a loose
rein, which was for them another unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>On the French stage, tradition went back as far as Rachel,
although my mother never saw her, and I don’t think my
father did; but Desclée was said to be an incomparable artist,
of the high-strung, nervous, delicate type. The accounts of
her remind one of Elenora Duse, whose acting delighted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
father when he saw her. “Est-elle jolie?” someone said of
Desclée. “Non, elle est pire.”</p>

<p>Another name which meant something definite to me was
that of Fargeuil, who I imagine was an intensely emotional
actress with a wonderful charm of expression and utterance.
My father was never surprised at people preferring the new to
the old. He seemed to expect it, and when I once told him later
that I preferred Stevenson to Scott, a judgment I have since
revised and reversed, he was not in the least surprised, and said:
“Of course, it must be so; it is more modern.” But he was
glad to find I enjoyed Dickens, laughed at <i>Pickwick</i>, and
thought <i>Vanity Fair</i> an interesting book, when I read these
books later at school.</p>

<p>We were taken to see some good acting before I went to
school. We saw the last performances of <i>School</i> and <i>Ours</i> at
the Haymarket with the Bancrofts. My mother always spoke
of Mrs. Bancroft as Marie Wilton: we saw Hare in <i>The Colonel</i>
and the <i>Quiet Rubber</i>; Mrs. Kendal in the <i>Ironmaster</i>, and Sarah
Bernhardt in <i>Hernani</i>. She had left the Théâtre français
then, and was acting with her husband, M. Damala. This,
of course, was the greatest excitement of all, as I knew many
passages of the play, and the whole of the last act by heart.
I can remember now Sarah’s exquisite modulation of voice
when she said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tout s’est éteint, flambeaux et musique de fête,</div>
<div class="verse">Rien que la nuit et nous, félicité parfaite.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The greatest theatrical treat of all was to go to the St. James’s
Theatre, because Mr. Hare was a great friend of the family and
used to come and stay at Membland, so that when we went to his
theatre we used to go behind the scenes. I saw several of his
plays: Pinero’s <i>Hobby Horse</i>, <i>Lady Clancarty</i>, and the first
night of <i>As You Like It</i>. This was on Saturday, 24th January
1885.</p>

<p>One night we were given the Queen’s box at Covent Garden
by Aunt M’aimée, and we went to the opera. It was <i>Aïda</i>.</p>

<p>We also saw Pasca in <i>La joie fait peur</i>, so that the tradition
that my sisters could hand on to their children was linked with
a distant past.</p>

<p>When Mary Anderson first came to London we went to see
her in the <i>Lady of Lyons</i>, and never shall I forget her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
entrance on the stage. This was rendered the more impressive
by an old lady with white hair making an entrance just before
Mary Anderson, and Cecil, who was with us, pretending to think
she was Mary Anderson, and saying with polite resignation that
she was a little less young than he had expected. When Mary
Anderson did appear, her beauty took our breath away; she
was dressed in an Empire gown with her hair done in a pinnacle,
and she looked like a picture of the Empress Josephine: radiant
with youth, and the kind of beauty that is beyond and above
discussion; eyes like stars, classic arms, a nobly modelled face,
and matchless grace of carriage. Next year we all went in a box
to see her in <i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i>, a play that I was never
tired of reproducing afterwards on my toy theatre.</p>

<p>As I grew older, I remember going to one or two grown-up
parties in London. One was at Grosvenor House, a garden
party, with, I think, a bazaar going on. There was a red-coated
band playing in the garden, and my cousin, Betty Ponsonby,
who was there, asked me to go and ask the band to play a valse
called “Jeunesse Dorée.” I did so, spoke to the bandmaster,
and walked to the other end of the lawn. To my surprise I saw
the whole band following me right across the lawn, and taking
up a new position at the place I had gone to. Whether they
thought I had meant they could not be heard where they were,
I don’t know, but I was considerably embarrassed; so, I think,
was my cousin, Betty.</p>

<p>Another party I remember was at Stafford House. My
mother was playing the violin in an amateur ladies’ string-band,
conducted by Lady Folkestone. My cousin, Bessie Bulteel,
had to accompany Madame Neruda in a violin solo and pianoforte
duet. The Princess of Wales and the three little princesses were
sitting in the front row on red velvet chairs. The Princess of
Wales in her orders and jewels seemed to me, and I am sure to
all the grown-up people as well, like the queen of a fairy-tale
who had strayed by chance into the world of mortals; she was
different and more graceful than anyone else there.</p>

<p>There is one kind of beauty which sends grown-up people
into raptures, but which children are quite blind to; but there
is another and rarer order of beauty which, while it amazes the
grown-up and makes the old cry, binds children with a spell.
It is an order of beauty in which the grace of every movement,
the radiance of the smile, and the sure promise of lasting youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the cut of the face make you forget all other attributes, however
perfect.</p>

<p>Of such a kind was the grace and beauty of the Princess of
Wales. She was as lovely then as Queen Alexandra.</p>

<p>I was taken by my father in my black velvet suit. I was
sitting on a chair somewhere at the end of a row, and couldn’t
see very well. One of the little princesses smiled at me and
beckoned to me, so I boldly walked up and sat next to them,
and the Princess of Wales then took me on her knee, greatly to
the surprise of my mother when she walked on to the platform
with the band. The audience was splendid and crowded with
jewelled beauties, and I remember one of the grown-ups asking
another: “Which do you admire most, Lady Clarendon or Lady
Dudley?”</p>

<p>Another party I remember was an afternoon party at Sir
Frederic Leighton’s house, with music. Every year he gave
this party, and every year the same people were invited. The
music was performed by the greatest artists: Joachim, Madame
Neruda, Piatti the violoncellist, and the best pianists of the
day, in a large Moorish room full of flowers. It was the most
intimate of concerts. The audience, which was quite small,
used to sit in groups round the pianoforte, and only in the
more leisurely London of the ’eighties could you have had such
an exquisite performance and so naturally cultivated, so unaffectedly
musical an audience. The Leighton party looked
like a Du Maurier illustration.</p>

<p>When we were in London my father would sometimes come
back on Saturday afternoons with a present for one of us, not a
toy, but something much more rare and fascinating—a snuff-box
that opened with a trick, or a bit of china. These were kept for
us by Chérie in a cupboard till we should be older. One day
he took out of a vitrine a tiny doll’s cup of dark blue Sèvres
which belonged to a large service and gave it me, and I have
got it now. But the present I enjoyed more than any I have
ever received in my life, except, perhaps, the fifty-shilling train,
was one day when we were walking down a path at Membland,
he said: “This is your path; I give it to you and the gate at the
end.” It was the inclusion of the little iron gate at the end
which made that present poignantly perfect.</p>

<p>There was no end to my father’s generosity. His gifts were
on a large scale and reached far and wide. He used to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Breguet watches; but he did not keep them; he gave them
away to people who he thought would like one. He had a
contempt for half measures, and liked people to do the big
thing on a large scale. “So-and-so,” he used to say, “has behaved
well.” That meant had been big and free-handed, and
above small and mean considerations. He liked the <i>best</i>: the
old masters, a Turner landscape, a Velasquez, a Watteau;
good furniture, good china, good verse, and good acting;
Shakespeare, which he knew by heart, so if you went with
him to a play such as <i>Hamlet</i>, he could have prompted the
players; Schiller, Juvenal, Pope, and Dryden and Byron; the
acting of the Comédie française, and Ellen Terry’s diction
and pathos. Tennyson was spoilt for him by the mere existence
of the “May Queen”; but when he saw a good modern
thing, he admired it. He said that Mrs. Patrick Campbell
in her performance of Mrs. Ebbsmith, which we went to the
first night of, was a real <i>Erscheinung</i>, and when all the pictures
of Watts were exhibited together at Burlington House he
thought that massed performance was that of a great man.
He was no admirer of Burne-Jones, but the four pictures of
the “Briar Rose” struck him as great pictures.</p>

<p>He was quite uninsular, and understood the minds and the
ways of foreigners. He talked foreign languages not only
easily, but naturally, without effort or affectation, and native
turns of expression delighted him, such as a German saying,
“Lieber Herr Oberkellner,” or, as I remember, a Frenchman
saying after a performance of a melodrama at a Casino where
the climax was rather tamely executed, “Ce coup de pistolet
était un peu mince.” And once I won his unqualified praise by
putting at the end of a letter, which I had written to my Italian
master at Florence, and which I had had to send <i>via</i> the city
in order to have a money order enclosed with it, “Abbi la
gentilezza di mandarmi un biglettino.” This use of a diminutive
went straight to my father’s heart. Nothing amused him
more than instances of John Bullishness; for instance, a young
man who once said to him at Contrexéville: “I hate abroad.”</p>

<p>He conformed naturally to the customs of other countries,
and as he had travelled all over the world, he was familiar with
the mind and habit of every part of Europe. He was completely
unselfconscious, and was known once when there was
a ball going on in his own house at Charles Street to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
disappeared into his dressing-room, undressed, and walked in
his dressing-gown through the dining-room, where people were
having supper, with a bedroom candle in his hand to the back
staircase to go up to his bedroom. His warmth of heart was
like a large generous fire, and the people who warmed their
hands at it were without number.</p>

<p>With all his comprehension of foreigners and their ways, he
was intensely English; and he was at home in every phase of
English life, and nowhere more so than pottering about farms
and fields on his grey cob, saying: “The whole of that fence
must come down—every bit of it,” or playing whist and saying
about his partner, one of my aunts: “Good God, what a fool
the woman is!”</p>

<p>Whist reminds me of a painful episode. I have already
said that I learnt to play long whist in the housekeeper’s room.
I was proud of my knowledge, and asked to play one night after
dinner at Membland with the grown-ups. They played short
whist. I got on all right at first, and then out of anxiety I
revoked. Presently my father and mother looked at each other,
and a mute dialogue took place between them, which said
clearly: “Has he revoked?” “Yes, he has.” They said
nothing about it, and when the rubber was over my father said:
“The dear little boy played very nicely.” But I minded their
not knowing that I knew that they knew, almost as much as
having revoked. It was a bitter mortification—a real humiliation.
Later on when I was bigger and at school, the girls and
I used to play every night with my father, and our bad play,
which never improved, made him so impatient that we invented
a code of signals saying, “Bêchez” when we wanted
spades to lead, and other words for the other suits.</p>

<p>A person whom we were always delighted to see come into
the house was our Uncle Johnny. When we were at school he
always tipped us. If we were in London he always suggested
going to a play and taking all the stalls.</p>

<p>When we went out hunting with the Dartmoor foxhounds
he always knew exactly what the fox was going to do, and where
it was going. And he never bothered one at the Meet. I
always thought the Meet spoilt the fun of hunting. Every
person one knew used to come up, say that either one’s girths
were too tight or one’s stirrups too long or too short, and set
about making some alteration. I was always a bad horseman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
although far better as a child than as a grown-up person. And
I knew for certain that if there was an open gate with a crowd
going through it, my pony would certainly make a dart through
that crowd, the gate would be slammed and I should not be
able to prevent this happening, and there would be a chorus
of curses. But under the guidance of Uncle Johnny everything
always went well.</p>

<p>Whenever he came to Membland, the first thing he would
do would be to sit down and write a letter. He must have had
a vast correspondence. Then he would tell stories in Devonshire
dialect which were inimitable.</p>

<p>There are some people who, directly they come into the
room, not by anything they say or do, not by any display of
high spirits or effort to amuse, make everything brighter and
more lively and more gay, especially for children, and Uncle
Johnny was one of those. As the Bulteel family lived close to
us, we saw them very often. They all excelled at games and
at every kind of outdoor sport. The girls were fearless riders and
drivers and excellent cricketers. Cricket matches at Membland
were frequent in the summer. Many people used to drive from
Plymouth to play lawn-tennis at Pamflete, the Bulteels’ house.</p>

<p>We saw most of Bessie Bulteel, who was the eldest girl. She
was a brilliant pianist, with a fairylike touch and electric execution,
and her advent was the greatest treat of my childhood.
She told thrilling ghost stories, which were a fearful joy, but
which made it impossible for me to pass a certain piece of
Italian furniture on the landing which had a painted Triton on
it. It looks a very harmless piece of furniture now. I saw it
not long ago in my brother Cecil’s house. It is a gilt writing-table
painted with varnished figures, nymphs and fauns, in the
Italian manner. The Triton sprawls on one side of it recumbent
beside a cool source. Nothing could be more peaceful or idyllic,
but I remember the time when I used to rush past it on the
passage in blind terror.</p>

<p>A picturesque figure, as of another age, was my great-aunt,
Lady Georgiana Grey, who came to Membland once in my childhood.
She was old enough to have played the harp to Byron.
She lived at Hampton Court and played whist every night of
her life, and sometimes went up to London to the play when
she was between eighty and ninety. She was not deaf, her
sight was undimmed, and she had a great contempt for people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
who were afraid of draughts. She had a fine aptitude for flat
contradiction, and she was a verbal conservative, that is to say,
she had a horror of modern locutions and abbreviations, piano
for pianoforte, balcŏny for balcōni, cucumber for cowcumber,
Montagu for Mountagu, soot for sut, yellow for yallow.</p>

<p>She wore on her little finger an antique onyx ring with a
pig engraved on it, and I asked her to give it me. She said:
“You shall have it when you are older.” An hour later I went
up to her room and said: “I am older now. Can I have the
ring?” She gave it me. Nobody ever sat at a table so bolt
upright as she did, and she lived to be ninety-nine. She came
back once to Membland after my sisters were married.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest excitement of all our Membland life
was when the whole of the Harbord family, our cousins, used to
arrive for Christmas. Our excitement knew no bounds when
we knew they were coming, and Chérie used to get so tired of
hearing the Harbords quoted that I remember her one day
in the schoolroom in London opening the window, taking the
lamp to it and saying: “J’ouvre cette fenêtre pour éclairer
la famille Harbord.”</p>

<p>On rainy days at Membland there were two rare treats:
one was to play hide-and-seek all over the house; the other was
to make toffee and perhaps a gingerbread cake in the still-room.
The toffee was the ultra-sticky treacle kind, and the
cake when finished and baked always had a wet hole in the
middle of it. Hugo and I used to spend a great deal of time in
Mr. Ellis’ carpenter’s shop. We had tool-boxes of our own, and
we sometimes made Christmas presents for our father and
mother; but our carpentry was a little too imaginative and
rather faulty in execution.</p>

<p>Not far from Membland and about a mile from Pamflete
there was a small grey Queen Anne house called “Mothecombe.”
It nestled on the coast among orchards and quite close to the
sandy beach of Mothecombe Bay, the only sandy beach on our
part of the South Devon coast. This house belonged to the
Mildmays, and we often met the Mildmay family when we went
over there for picnics.</p>

<p>Aunt Georgie Mildmay was not only an expert photographer,
but she was one of the first of those rare people who have
had a real talent for photography and achieved beautiful and
artistic results with it, both in portraits and landscapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever Hugo and I used to go and see her in London at
46 Berkeley Square, where she lived, she always gave us a
pound, and never a holiday passed without our visiting Aunt
Georgie.</p>

<p>Mothecombe was often let or lent to friends in summer. One
summer Lady de Grey took it, and she came over to luncheon at
Membland, a vision of dazzling beauty, so that, as someone said,
you saw green after looking at her. It was like looking at the
sun. The house was often taken by a great friend of our family,
Colonel Ellis, who used to spend the summer there with his
family, and he frequently stayed at Membland with us. I
used to look forward to going down to dinner when he was there,
and listening to his conversation. He was the most perfect
of talkers, because he knew what to say to people of all ages,
besides having an unending flow of amusing things to tell,
for he made everything he told amusing, and he would sometimes
take the menu and draw me a picture illustrating the
games and topics that interested us at the moment. We had
a game at one time which was to give someone three people
they liked equally, and to say those three people were on the
top of a tower; one you could lead down gently by the hand,
one you must kick down, and the third must be left to be
picked by the crows.</p>

<p>We played this one evening, and the next day Colonel Ellis
appeared with a charming pen-and-ink drawing of a Louis-Quinze
Marquis leading a <i>poudré</i> lady gently by the hand. If
he gave one a present it would be something quite unique—unlike
what anyone else could think of; once it was, for me, a
silver mug with a twisted handle and my name engraved on it
in italics, “<i>Maurice Baring’s Mug</i>, 1885.” His second son,
Gerald, was a little bit older than I was, and we were great
friends. Gerald had a delightfully grown-up and blasé manner
as a child, and one day, with the perfect manner of a man of
the world, he said to me, talking of Queen Victoria, “The fact is,
the woman’s raving mad.”</p>

<p>We used to call Colonel Ellis “the gay Colonel” to carefully
distinguish him from Colonel Edgcumbe, whom we
considered a more serious Colonel. The Mount Edgcumbes
were neighbours, and lived just over the Cornish border at
Mount Edgcumbe. Colonel Edgcumbe was Lord Mount
Edgcumbe’s brother, and often stayed with us. He used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be mercilessly teased, especially by the girls of the Bulteel
family. One year he was shooting with us and the Bulteels
got hold of his cartridges and took out the shot, leaving a
few good cartridges.</p>

<p>He was put at the hot corner. Rocketing pheasants in
avalanches soared over his head, and he, of course, missed
them nearly all, shooting but one or two. He explained for
the rest of the day that it was a curious thing, and that something
must be wrong, either with his eyes or with the climate.
Some new way of tormenting was always found, and, although
he was not the kind of man who naturally enjoys a practical
joke, he bore it angelically.</p>

<p>His sister, Lady Ernestine, was rather touchy in the matter
of Devonshire clotted cream. As Mount Edgcumbe was just
over the border in Cornwall, and as clotted cream was made in
Cornwall as well as in Devonshire, she resented its being called
Devonshire cream and used to call it Cornish cream; but when
she stayed with us, not wishing to concede the point and yet
unwilling to hurt our feelings, she used to call it West-country
cream.</p>

<p>Another delightful guest was Miss Pinkie Browne, who was
Irish, gay, argumentative, and contradictious, with smiling
eyes, her hair in a net, and an infectious laugh. As a girl she
had broken innumerable hearts, but had always refused to
marry, as she never could make up her mind. She was extremely
musical, and used to sing English and French songs,
accompanying herself, with an intoxicating lilt and a languishing
expression. As Dr. Smyth says about Tosti’s singing, it was
small art, but it was real art. And her voice must have had a
rare quality, as she was about fifty when I heard her. Such
singing is far more enjoyable than that of professional singers,
and makes one think of Tosti’s saying: “Le chant est un truc.”
She would make a commonplace song poignantly moving. She
used to sing a song called “The Conscript’s Farewell”:</p>

<p>Membland was always full of visitors. There were visitors
at Easter, visitors at Whitsuntide, in the autumn for the shooting,
and a houseful at Christmas: an uncle, General Baring,
who used to shoot with one arm because he had lost the other
in the Crimea; my father’s cousin, Lord Ashburton, who was
particular about his food, and who used to say: “That’s a
very good dish, but it’s not <i>veau à la bourgeoise</i>”; Godfrey
Webb, who always wrote a little poem in the visitors’ book when
he went away; Lord Granville, who knew French so alarmingly
well, and used to ask one the French for words like a big stone
upright on the edge of a road and a ship tacking, till one longed
to say, like the Red Queen in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>: “What’s
the French for fiddle de dee?”; Lord and Lady Lansdowne,
Mr. and Mrs. Percy Wyndham—Mr. Wyndham used to take me
out riding; he was deliciously inquisitive, so that if one was
laughing at one side of the table he would come to one quietly
afterwards and ask what the joke had been about; Harry
Cust, radiant with youth and spirits and early success; Lady de
Clifford and her two daughters (Katie and Maud Russell), she
carrying an enormous silk bag with her work in it—she was a
kind critic of our French plays; Lady Airlie, and her sister,
Miss Maude Stanley, who started being a vegetarian in the
house, and told me that Henry <span class="smcapuc">VIII.</span> was a much misunderstood
monarch; Madame Neruda, and once, long before she married
him, Sir Charles Hallé. Sir Charles Hallé used to sit down
at the pianoforte after dinner, and nothing could dislodge him.
Variation followed variation, and repeat followed repeat of the
stiffest and driest classical sonatas. And one night when this
had been going on past midnight, my father, desperate with
impatience and sleep, put out the electric light. I am not
making an anachronism in talking of electric light, as it had
just been put in the house, and was thought to be a most daring
innovation.</p>

<p>We had a telegraph office in the house, which was worked
by Mrs. Tudgay. It was a fascinating instrument, rather like
a typewriter with two dials and little steel keys round one of
them, and the alphabet was the real alphabet and not the
Morse Code. It was convenient having this in the house, but
one of the results was that so many jokes were made with it,
and so many bogus telegrams arrived, that nobody knew
whether a telegram was a real one or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Walter Durnford, then an Eton House master, and
afterwards Provost of King’s, in a poem he wrote in the
visitors’ book, speaks of Membland as a place where everything
reminded you of the presence of fairy folk, “Where
telegrams come by the dozen, concocted behind the door.”</p>

<p>Certainly people enjoyed themselves at Membland, and the
Christmas parties were one long riot of dance, song, and laughter.
Welcome ever smiled at Membland, and farewell went out
sighing.</p>

<p>As I got nearer and nearer to the age of ten, when it was
settled that I should go to school, life seemed to become more
and more wonderful every day. Both at Membland and in
Charles Street the days went by in a crescendo of happiness.
Walks with Chérie in London were a daily joy, especially when
we went to Covent Garden and bought chestnuts to roast for
tea. The greatest tea treat was to get Chérie, who was an
inspired cook, to make something she called <i>la petite sauce</i>.
You boiled eggs hard in the kettle; and then, in a little china
frying-pan over a spirit lamp, the sauce was made, of butter,
cream, vinegar, pepper, and the eggs were cut up and floated
in the delicious hot mixture. A place of great treats where
we sometimes went on Saturday afternoons was the Aquarium,
where acrobats did wonderful things, and you had your bumps
told and your portrait cut out in black-and-white silhouette.
The phrenologist was not happy in his predictions of my future,
as he said I had a professional and mathematical head, and
would make a good civil engineer in after-life.</p>

<p>Going to the play was the greatest treat of all, and if I
heard there was any question of their going to the play downstairs,
and Mr. Deacon, my father’s servant, always used to
tell me when tickets were being ordered, I used to go on my
knees in the night nursery and pray that I might be taken too.
Sometimes the answer was direct.</p>

<p>One night my mother and Lord Mount Edgcumbe were
going to a pantomime together by themselves. Mr. Deacon
told me, and asked me if I was going too, but nothing had been
said about it. I prayed hard, and I went down to my mother’s
bedroom as she was dressing for dinner. No word of the pantomime
was mentioned on either side. She then, while her hair
was being done by D., asked for a piece of paper and scribbled
a note and told me to take it down to my father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>I did so, and my father said: “Would you like to go to the
pantomime, too?” The answer was in the affirmative.</p>

<p>What a fever one would be in to start in time and to be
there at the beginning on nights when we went to the play!
how terribly anxious not to miss one moment! How wonderful
the moment was before the curtain went up! The delicious
suspense, the orchestra playing, and then the curtain rising on
a scene that sometimes took one’s breath away, and how calm
the grown-up people were. They would not look at the red
light in the background, the pink sky which looked like a real
pink sky, or perhaps some moving water. People say sometimes
it is bad for children to go to the theatre, but do they
ever enjoy anything in after life as much? Is there any such
magic as the curtain going up on the Demon’s cave in the
pantomime, or the sight in the Transformation scene of two
silvery fairies rising from the ground on a gigantic wedding cake,
and the clown suddenly breaking on the scene, shouting, “Here
we are again!” through a shower of gold rain and a cloud of
different-coloured Bengal lights? Is there any such pleasure
as in suddenly seeing and recognising things in the flesh one
had been familiar with for long from books and stories, such
as Cinderella’s coach, the roc’s egg in Sinbad the Sailor, or
Aladdin’s cave, or the historical processions of the kings of
England, some of whom you clapped and some of whom you
hissed? Oh! the charm of changing scenery! a ship moving
or still better sinking, a sunset growing red, a forest growing
dark; and then the fun! The indescribable fun, of seeing
Cinderella’s sisters being knocked about in the kitchen, or
the Babes in the Wood being put to bed, and kicking all
their bedclothes off directly they had settled down; or best
of all, the clown striking the pantaloon with the red-hot
poker and the harlequin getting the better of the policeman!
Harry Paine was the clown in those days, and he used, in a
hoarse voice, to say to the pantaloon: “I say, Joey.” “Yes,
master,” answered the pantaloon in a feeble falsetto.</p>

<p>Childhood bereft of such treats I cannot help thinking must
be a sad affair; and it generally happens that if children are
not allowed to go to the play, so that they shall enjoy it more
when they are grown-up, they end by never being able to
enjoy it at all.</p>

<p>One great event of the summer was the Eton and Harrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
match, when Cecil and Everard used to come up from Eton with
little pieces of light blue silk in their black coats. John had
gone to Cambridge, and I hardly remember him as an Eton boy.
We used to go on a coach belonging to some friends, and one year
one of the Parkers bowled three of the Harrow boys running.</p>

<p>As Chérie had been with Lord Macclesfield in the Parker
family before she came to us, and as this boy, Alex Parker, had
either been or nearly been one of her pupils, she had a kind of
reflected glory from the event.</p>

<p>Eton was always surrounded with a glamour of romance.
John had rowed stroke in the Eton eight, and when Cecil rose
to the dignity of being Captain of the Oppidans we were
proud indeed. One summer we all went down to Eton for
the 4th of June.</p>

<p>We went to speeches and had tea in Cecil’s room, and strawberry
messes, and walked about in the playing-fields and saw
the procession of boats and the fireworks.</p>

<p>From that day I was filled with a longing to go to Eton,
and resented bitterly having to go to a private school first.</p>

<p>Another exciting event I remember was a visit to Windsor,
to the Norman Tower in Windsor Castle, where my uncle,
Henry Ponsonby, and my Aunt M’aimée lived. This happened
one year in the autumn. We stayed a Sunday there. The
house was, for a child, fraught with romance and interest. First
of all there were the prisons. My aunt had discovered and laid
bare the stone walls of two octagonal rooms in the tower which
had been prisons in the olden times for State prisoners, and she
had left the walls bare. There were on them inscriptions
carved by the prisoners. She had made these two rooms her
sitting-rooms, and they were full of books, and there was a
carpenter’s bench in one of these rooms, with a glass of water on
it ready for painting.</p>

<p>Windsor was itself exciting enough, but I think what struck
me most then was the toy cupboard of the boys, Fritz, Johnny,
and Arthur. All their toys were arranged in tiers in a little
windowless room, a tier belonging to each separate boy, and in
the middle of each beautiful and symmetrical arrangement
there were toys representing a little room with a table and lamp
on it. As if all this was not exciting enough, my Cousin Betty
told me the story of the Corsican Brothers.</p>

<p>Before I went to school my father had to go to Contrexéville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to take the waters. My father and mother took me with
them. I faintly regretted not playing a solo at Mademoiselle
Ida’s pupils’ concert, which was to have been part of the programme,
but otherwise the pleasure and excitement at going
were unmitigated. We started for Paris in July. Bessie Bulteel
came with us, and we stopped a night in Paris, at the Hôtel
Bristol. My father took me for a walk in the Rue de la Paix,
and the next day we went to Contrexéville. I never enjoyed
anything more in my life than those three weeks at Contrexéville.
There were shops in the hotel gardens called <i>les Galeries</i>, where
a charming old lady, called Madame Paillard, with her daughter,
Thérèse, sold the delicious sweets of Nancy, and spoilt me
beyond words. The grown-up people played at <i>petits chevaux</i> in
the evening, and as I was not allowed to join in that game, the
lady of the <i>petits chevaux</i>, Mademoiselle Rose, had a kind of
rehearsal of the game in the afternoon at half-price, in which
only I and the actresses of the Casino, whom I made great
friends with, took part. My special friend was Mademoiselle
Tusini of the Eldorado Paris Music Hall. She was a songstress.</p>

<p>One day she asked me to beg Madame Aurèle, the <i>directrice</i> of
the Theatre, to let her sing a song at the Casino which she had
not been allowed to sing, and which was called “Les allumettes
du Général.” Mademoiselle Tusini said it was her greatest
success, and that when she had sung it at Nancy, nobody knew
where to look. I pleaded her cause; but Madame Aurèle said,
“Un jour quand il n’y aura que des Messieurs,” so I am afraid
the song can hardly have been quite nice. When we went away,
Mademoiselle Tusini gave me a large photograph of herself in
the rôle of a <i>commère</i>, carrying a wand. Chérie was slightly
astonished when she saw it, and when I described the great
beauty and the wonderful goodness of Mademoiselle Tusini, she
was not as enthusiastically sympathetic as I could have wished.</p>

<p>There were a great many French children at Contrexéville,
and I was allowed to join in their games. There was a charming
old curé who I made friends with in the village, and his church
was the first Catholic church I ever entered.</p>

<p>My mother and father used to go to the Casino play every
night. I was allowed to go once or twice, as Mademoiselle Tusini
had threatened to strike if I left Contrexéville without seeing
her act, so I was taken to <i>Monsieur Choufleury restera chez lui</i>, a
harmless farce, which is, I believe, often acted by amateurs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>We stayed there three weeks, and I left in sorrow and tears.
We went on for a <i>Nachkur</i> to a place in the Vosges called
Géradmer, which is near a lake. One day we drove to a place
called the <i>Schlucht</i>, and saw the stone marking the frontier into
Alsace, which was, of course, Germany. It was suggested that
we should cross over, but I, mindful of Chérie, refused to set
foot on the stolen and violated territory.</p>

<p>On the way back we stayed a day and night in Paris, and
bought presents for all those at home. In the evening we went
to the Théâtre français and saw no less an actor than Delaunay
in Musset’s play, <i>On ne badine pas avec l’Amour</i>. Delaunay had
a voice like silver, and his diction on the stage was incomparable.
I remember Count Benckendorff once saying about him that
whereas one often bewailed the failure of an actor to look the
part of a <i>grand seigneur</i>, when one saw Delaunay one wished
anyone off the stage could be half as distinguished as he was on
the stage.</p>

<p>My father took me to the Louvre and showed me the <i>Mona
Lisa</i> and Watteau’s large picture of a Pierrot: “Gilles” and
the <i>Galérie d’Apollon</i>, and late in the afternoon we drove to
the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>Chérie had always told us of the <i>Magasin du Louvre</i>, where
as children went out they were given, as George, in the poem,
when he had been as good as gold, an immense balloon. This
balloon had always been one of my dreams, and we went there,
and the reality was fully up to all expectations.</p>

<p>We bought some <i>nonnettes</i> in the Rue St. Honoré and a great
many toys at the <i>Paradis des Enfants</i>.</p>

<p>The next time I went to Contrexéville I was at school. I wore
an Eton jacket and a top hat in Paris; this created a sensation.
A man said to me in the Rue de Rivoli, “Monsieur a son Gibus.”
I also remember receiving a wonderful welcome in the <i>Galeries</i>.</p>

<p>With the end of the first visit to Contrexéville I will end
this chapter, for it was the end of a chapter of life, the happiest
and most wonderful chapter of all. New gates were opened;
but the gate on the fairyland of childhood was shut, and for
ever afterwards one could only look through the bars, but never
more be a free and lawful citizen of that enchanted country,
where life was like a fairy-tale that seemed almost too good to be
true, and yet so endlessly long and so infinitely happy that it
seemed as if it must last for ever.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">SCHOOL</span></h2>

<p>I went to school in September 1884. On the 7th of
September John came of age, and we had a large party
in the house and a banquet for the tenants in the tennis
court, at which I had to stand up on a chair and make a speech
returning thanks for the younger members of the family. I
travelled up to London with my mother and Mr. Walter Durnford,
and was given <i>Frank Fairleigh</i> to read in the train, but it
was too grown-up for me, and I only pretended to read it. We
stayed a night in Charles Street. I was given a brown leather
dispatch case with my name stamped on it and a framed photograph
of my father and mother and of Membland, and a good
stock of writing-paper, and the next afternoon we started for
my school, which was near Ascot. I didn’t cry either on
leaving Membland or at any moment on the day I was taken
to school.</p>

<p>We arrived about tea-time. The school was a red brick
building on the top of the hill, north of Ascot Station, and
looking towards the station, situated among pine trees. The
building is there now and is a girls’ school. We were shown into
a drawing-room where the Headmaster and his wife received
us with a dreadful geniality. There was a small aquarium
in the room with some goldfish in it. The furniture was
covered with black-and-yellow cretonne, and there were some
low ebony bookcases and a great many knick-knacks. Another
parent was there with a small and pale-looking little boy
called Arbuthnot, who was the picture of misery, and well
he might look miserable, as I saw at a glance that he was
wearing a made-up sailor’s tie. Two days later the machinery
inside this tie was a valuable asset in another boy’s collection.
Conversation was kept up hectically until tea was over. They
talked of a common friend, Lady Sarah Spencer. “What a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
charming woman she is!” said the Headmaster. How sensible
he seemed to charm! How impervious to all amenities he
revealed himself to be later! Then my mother said good-bye
to him, and we were taken upstairs by the matron to see my
cubicle, a little room with pitch-pine walls, partitioned off from
the next cubicle by a thin wooden partition that did not reach
the ceiling, so that you could talk to the boy in the next cubicle.
Boys were not allowed to go into each other’s cubicles. We
hung my solitary picture up, and my mother interviewed
the matron, Mrs. Otway, in her room and gave her a pound as
she went away; then we went out into the garden for a moment.
My mother said good-bye to me and left me alone. I wandered
about the garden, which was not a garden but grass hill leading
down to a cricket-field. Half-way down the hill was a gymnasium,
and a high wooden erection with steps. I wondered
what it was for. The boys had not yet arrived. Two boys
presently appeared on the scene; they looked at me, but took
no great notice. Then after a little time one of them approached
me, holding in his hand a small pebble surrounded with
cotton-wool, and asked me if I would like a cuckoo’s egg. I
did not know whether I was supposed to pretend that I thought
it was a real egg or not. It was so unmistakably a stone. I
smiled and said nothing. Presently a Chinese gong sounded
somewhere out of doors. The two boys ran into the house. I
followed them. On the ground floor of the house there was a
large hall with a table running down it, a fireplace at one end,
and at the other end an arch opening on to the staircase draped
with red curtains with black fleur-de-lys stamped on them.
There were windows on one side of the room and a cupboard with
books in on the other. This hall was now full of boys talking
and laughing. Nobody took the slightest notice of me. They
then trooped through a passage into the dining-room, a large
room with tables round three sides of it and a small square
table in the middle where the Headmaster, his wife, and one of
the other masters sat. We sat down. I was placed nearly at
the end of the last table. More boys—those of the first division,
who were a race apart—came in from another door. Then the
Headmaster entered, rapped on his table with a knife, and said
grace. We had tea; large thick slabs of bread and butter, with
the butter spread very thinly over them.</p>

<p>Soon after tea we went to bed, and I dreamt I was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Membland, and woke up to find I was in a strange place. The
boy in the cubicle next to mine was called Hope. He was
in the second division. In another cubicle opposite to mine
there was a boy in the first division called Worthington. One
could talk to them, and they were both of them friendly.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast I was placed in the fourth
division for Latin and English, and the fourth set for Mathematics
and French, and had my first lesson in Mathematics.
The first thing the master did was to take a high three-legged
stool from a corner and exhibit it to us. It had a very narrow
seat. It was a rickety stool. “This,” he said, “is the stool of
penitence. I hope none of you will have to stand on it.” Then
some figures were written down on the blackboard, and a sum
in short division was set, which I at once got wrong. In fact,
I couldn’t do it at all. The master came and sat down by my
side, and said: “You’re trembling.” So I was. He corrected
the mistakes and went on to something else. He was terrifying
to look at, I thought, but perhaps not as frightening as he
appeared to be. I was a little bit reassured. Later in the
day we had a French lesson. To my surprise I saw he knew
but little French, and read out the first page of the elementary
accidence, pronouncing the French words as though they were
English ones.</p>

<p>After luncheon, we played prisoner’s base, and I at once
realised that there is a vast difference between games and play.
Play is played for fun, but games are deadly serious, and you do
not play them to enjoy yourselves. Everyone was given two
blue cards, and every time you were taken prisoner you lost a
card. If you lost both you were kicked by the captain of the
side, who said we were a pack of dummies. The first week
seemed endlessly long, and acute homesickness pervaded every
moment of it. Waking up in the morning was the worst
moment. Every night I used to dream I was back at home,
every morning the moment of waking up was a sharp bewildering
shock. Our voices were tried, and I was put in the chapel
choir. The chapel choir had special privileges, but also long
half-hours of choir practice.</p>

<p>The masters laughed at me mercilessly for my pronunciation
of English. I don’t know what was wrong with it, except that
I said y<i>a</i>llow, <i>aint</i> for aren’t, and <i>ant</i> for aunt, but I did my
best to get out of this as soon as possible. Apart from idiosyncrasies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of pronunciation, my voice seemed to them comic, and
they used to imitate me by speaking through their noses whenever
I said anything. The boys at first entirely ignored one,
simply telling one to shut up if one spoke, but the boys in my
own division soon became friendly, especially an American
boy called Hamilton Fish the third. He was the first man to
be killed in the American-Spanish War in Cuba. There was
no bullying. One boy, although he was in the first division,
was charming, and treated one like a grown-up person. This
was Basil Blackwood. Even then he drew pictures which
were the delight of his friends. Another boy who was friendly
was Niall Campbell. Dreadful legends were told about
Winston Churchill, who had been taken away from the
school. His naughtiness appeared to have surpassed anything.
He had been flogged for taking sugar from the pantry,
and so far from being penitent, he had taken the Headmaster’s
sacred straw hat from where it hung over the door
and kicked it to pieces. His sojourn at this school had been
one long feud with authority. The boys did not seem to
sympathise with him. Their point of view was conventional
and priggish.</p>

<p>Every morning there was a short service in the pitch-pine
school chapel, and every morning an interval between lessons
called the hour, in which the boys played nondescript games,
chiefly a game called IT. If you were IT you had to
catch someone else, and then he became IT. On Sunday
afternoon we went for a walk. On Sunday evening the Headmaster
read out a book called <i>The Last Abbot of Glastonbury</i>,
which I revelled in. After the first week I had got more or less
used to my new life. In a fortnight’s time I was quite happy
and enjoying myself; but every now and then life was marred
and made hideous for the time being by sudden and unexpected
dramas. The first drama was that of the Spanish chestnuts.
There were some Spanish chestnuts lying about in the garden.
We were told not to eat these. Some of the boys did eat
them, and one boy gave me a piece of something to eat on the
end of a knife. It was no bigger than a crumb, and it turned
out afterwards to be a bit of Spanish chestnut, or at least I
thought it might have been. One afternoon at tea the Head
rapped on his table with his knife. There was a dead silence.
“All boys who have eaten Spanish chestnuts are to stand up.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Nobody stood up, and there was a long pause. I think the
boys were puzzled, and did not know they had been eating
Spanish chestnuts. I certainly did not know a Spanish chestnut
by sight. I had no chestnut on my conscience. After a very
long pause the Headmaster made some rather facetious remarks,
which I thought were meant to encourage us, but the other
boys, knowing him better, knew that they were ironical and
portended dreadful things. One boy stood up. Then, after a
slight pause, another; about four or five boys followed suit. I
suddenly remembered the incident of the penknife in the
gymnasium three days before. Could it have been that I had
eaten a Spanish chestnut? Was that little bit of white crumb
on the end of the knife a part of a Spanish chestnut? I had
not seen a whole Spanish chestnut anywhere. In any case I
had better be on the safe side, and I stood up. The Headmaster
made a cutting comment on boys who were so slow to own up.
A few more stood up, and that was all. The Head then delivered
a serious homily. We had been guilty of three things: greed,
disobedience, and deceit. We would all do two hours’ extra
work on a half-holiday.</p>

<p>There was electric light in the school, and the electric light
was oddly enough supposed to be under the charge of one
of the boys, who was called the Head Engineer. Clever and
precocious as this boy was, I cannot now believe that his office
was a serious one, although we took it seriously indeed at
the time. However that may be, nobody except this boy was
allowed to go into the engine-shed or to have anything to
do with the electric light. We were especially forbidden to
touch any of the switches in the house or ever to turn on or
off the electric light ourselves. Electric light in houses at
that time was a new thing, and few private houses were
lighted with it. One day one of the boys was visited by his
parents, and he could not resist turning on the electric light
in one of the rooms to show them what it was like. Unfortunately
the Head saw him do this through the window, and
directly his parents were gone the boy was flogged. Every
week the school newspaper appeared. It was edited by two
of the boys in the first division, and handed round to the
boys at tea-time. This was a trying and painful moment for
some of the boys, as there were often in this newspaper
scathing articles on the cricket or football play of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the boys written by one of the masters, and all mentioning
them by name; and as parents took in the newspaper it was
far from pleasant to be pilloried in this fashion. Just before
half-term another drama occurred. I was doing a sum in short
division, and another boy was waiting for me to go out. He was
impatient, and he said, “That’s right; don’t you see the answer
is 3456,” or whatever it was. I scribbled it down, but unfortunately
had left a mistake in the working, so the answer was right
and the sum was partly wrong. This was at once detected,
and I was asked if I had had any help. I said “Yes,” and I
was then accused of having wanted to get marks by unfair
means, and of having cheated. We did not even know these
particular sums received marks. The Division Master bit
his knuckles, and said he would report the matter to the Headmaster.
When I went into chapel from the vestry, robed in a
white surplice, he pinned a piece of paper with <i>cheat</i> on it, on
to my back. I was appalled, but as nothing happened immediately
I began to recover, and on the following Sunday when we
were writing home the master told me I could put in my Sunday
letter that I had done very well, and that I was his favourite
boy. This was only his fun, but I took it quite seriously, and I
did not put it in my letter, because I thought the praise excessive.
On Monday morning there was what was called “reading over.”
The boys sat in the hall, grouped in their divisions. The Headmaster
in a silk gown stood up at a high desk, the three undermasters
sat in a semicircle round him, also in gowns, and one
division after another went and stood up in front of the desk
while the report of the week’s work was read out. When the
fourth division went up, the news was read out that Duckworth
and Baring had been guilty of a conspiracy, and had tried to
get marks by unfair means. Duckworth was blamed even
more severely than I was, being an older boy.</p>

<p>We were told this would be mentioned in our report, and
that if anything of the kind occurred again we would be
flogged. When this was over, the boys turned on Duckworth
and myself and asked us how we could have done such a base
act. We were shunned like two cardsharpers, and it took us
some time to recover our normal position. The half-term report
was about nothing else, and my father was dreadfully upset.
My mother came down to see me, and I told her the whole
story, and I think she understood what had happened. I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
through the rest of the term without any fresh dramas, and did
well in trials at the end of the term.</p>

<p>One day my sister Susan unwittingly caused me annoyance
by writing to me and sealing the letter with her name, Susan.
The boys saw the seal and called out, “He’s got a sister called
Susan; he’s got a sister called Susan.” Sisters should be
warned never to let their Christian names come to the knowledge
of their brother’s schoolfellows. This kind of thing is
typical of private-school life. The boys were childish and conventional,
but they did not bully. It was the masters who
every now and then made life a misery. In spite of everything,
the boys were happy—in any case, they thought that was
happiness, as they knew no better.</p>

<p>In the afternoons we played Rugby football, an experience
which was in my case exactly what Max Beerbohm describes it
in one of his Essays: running about on the edge of a muddy
field. The second division master pursued the players with
exhortations and imprecations, and every now and then
a good kicking was administered to the less successful and
energetic players, which there were quite a number of. The
three best Rugby football players were allowed to wear on Sundays
a light blue velvet cap with a silver Maltese cross on it,
and a silver tassel. I am sorry to say that this cap was not
always given to the best players. It was given to the boys the
Headmaster liked best. What I enjoyed most were the readings
out by the Headmaster, which happened on Sunday afternoons
and sometimes on ordinary evenings. He read out several
excellent books: <i>The Moonstone</i>, the <i>Leavenworth Case</i>, a lot of
<i>Pickwick</i>, and, during my first term, <i>Treasure Island</i>. The little
events, the rages for stamp collecting and swopping, stag-beetle
races, aquariums, secret alphabets, chess tournaments, that
make up the interests of a boy’s everyday life outside his work
and his play, delighted me. I was a born collector but a bad
swopper, and made ludicrous bargains. I made great friends
with a new boy called Ferguson, and taught him how to play
Spankaboo. We never told anyone, and the secret was never
discovered. We used to find food for the game in bound copies
of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. We had drawing lessons and
music lessons, and I was delighted to find that my first school
piece was a <i>gigue</i> by Corelli that I had heard my mother play
at the concert at Stafford House, which I have already described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
At the end of the term came the school concert, for which there
were many rehearsals. I did not take any part in it, except
in the chorus, who sang “Adeste Fideles” in Latin at the
end of it.</p>

<p>Some scenes were acted from the <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>,
the same scenes we had acted at Membland, but I took no
part in them. Then came the unutterable joy of going home for
the holidays, which were spent at Membland. When I arrived
and had my first schoolroom tea I was rather rough with the
toast, and Chérie said: “Est-ce là les manières d’Ascot?” At
the end of the holidays I spent a few days in London, and
was taken to the play, and enjoyed other dissipations which
made me a day or two late in going back to school. The
holiday task was Bulwer Lytton’s <i>Harold</i>, which my mother
read out to me. As soon as I arrived at school I was given
the holiday-task paper and won the prize, a book called <i>Half-hours
in the Far South</i>, which I have never read, but which I
still possess and respect.</p>

<p>During the Lent term we had athletic sports: long jump,
high jump, hurdle, flat and obstacle races. I won a heat in a
hurdle race and nearly got a place in the final, the only approach
to an athletic achievement in the whole of my life. A curious
drama happened during this term. A boy called Phillimore
was the chief actor in it. He was in the first division. One day
the Headmaster went up to London. During his absence a
message was sent round in his name by one of the undermasters.
The message was brought by one of the boys
to the various divisions. It was to the effect that we were
allowed or not allowed to do some specific thing. When the
boy, who was new and inexperienced, brought the message into
the first division, Phillimore said to him, “Ask Mr. So-and-so
with my compliments whether the message is genuine.” “Do
you really want me to ask him?” asked the boy. “Yes, of
course,” said Phillimore. The little boy went back to the
master, who happened to be the severest of all the masters,
and said: “Phillimore wants to know whether the message is
genuine.” As soon as the Headmaster returned the whole
school was summoned, and the Headmaster in his black gown
told us the dreadful story of Phillimore’s unheard-of act.
Phillimore was had up in front of the whole school, and told
to explain his conduct. He said it was a joke, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had never dreamt that the boy would deliver the message.
The explanation was not accepted, and Phillimore was stripped
of his first division privileges. The privileges of the first
division were various: they were allowed to dig in a place
called the wilderness, which was a sand-heap through which
ran a light truck railway without an engine. They went on
special expeditions.</p>

<p>These expeditions need an explanation. Sometimes they
consisted merely of walks to Bagshot or Virginia Water, and
perhaps a picnic tea. Sometimes, as in the case of the first
division expeditions or the choir expedition, they were far more
elaborate, and consisted of a journey to London with sight-seeing,
or to places as far off as Bath and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>During my first term the choir went to Swindon to see the
Great Western Works, to Reading to see the Biscuit Factory,
and to Bath in one day, and we got home late in the night.
During my second term we spent a day in London inspecting
the Tower, the Mint, and other sights, and had tea at the house
of one of the boys’ parents, Colonel Broadwood, who lived in
Eccleston Square.</p>

<p>These expeditions were recorded in the school Gazette,
and when my mother heard of our having had tea with Colonel
Broadwood, she said: “Why should not the choir, next time they
came to London, have luncheon at Charles Street?” The idea
made me shudder, although I said nothing. The idea of having
one’s school life suddenly brought into one’s home life, to see
the Headmaster sitting down to luncheon in one’s home, seemed
to me altogether intolerable. My mother thought I would perhaps
be ashamed of the food for not being good enough, and said:
“If we had a very good luncheon.” But that wasn’t the
reason. It never happened. Anything more miserable than
the appearance of Broadwood when we had tea in his father’s
house cannot be imagined.</p>

<p>Nothing was more strange at this school than the sudden
way in which either a treat or a punishment descended on the
school. The treats, too, were of such a curious kind, and involved
so much travelling. Sometimes the first division would
be taken up <i>en masse</i> to a matinée. Sometimes they would be
away for nearly twenty-four hours. The punishments were
equally unexpected and curious. One boy was suddenly
flogged for cutting off a piece of his hair and keeping the piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in his drawer. In the second division the boys were punished
by electricity. The division was made to join hands, and a
strong electric shock was passed through it. This went on
until one day one boy, smarting from an overcharge of electricity,
took the battery and threw it at the master’s head, inflicting a
sharp wound. Nothing was said about this action, to the
immense astonishment of the boys, who thought it jolly of
him not to sneak.</p>

<p>We lived in an atmosphere of complete uncertainty. We
never knew if some quite harmless action would not be construed
into a mortal offence. Any criticism, explicit or implicit,
of the food was considered the greatest of crimes. The food
was good, and the boys had nothing to complain of, nor did
they, but they were sometimes punished for looking as if they
didn’t like the cottage pie.</p>

<p>One day I heard a boy use the expression “mighty good.”
The next day I said at breakfast that the porridge was <i>mighty</i>
good. The master overheard me and asked me what I said. I
answered, “I said the porridge was very good.” “No,” said
the master, “that is not exactly what you said.” I then
admitted to the use of the word <i>mighty</i>. This was thought
to be ironical, and I was stopped talking at meals for a week.</p>

<p>Another time a message was passed up to me to stop talking
at luncheon. This was frequently done; a message used to be
passed up saying: “Baring and Bell stop talking,” but sometimes
the boys used to be inattentive, and if one sat far up
table the message had a way of getting lost on the way. This
happened to me. I was stopped talking and the message
never reached me, and I went on talking gaily. Afterwards
the master sent for me and said, “You’ll find yourself in
Queer Street.” I was not allowed to remonstrate. I didn’t
even know what I was accused of at the time, and I was
stopped talking for a week.</p>

<p>The Headmaster was a virulent politician and a fanatical
Tory. On the 5th of November an effigy of Mr. Gladstone
used to be burnt in the grounds, and there was a little note
in the Gazette to say there were only seven Liberals in the
school, the least of whom was myself. The Gazette went on to
add that “needless to say, the school were supporters of the
Church and the State.” One day somebody rashly sent the
Head a Liberal circular. He sent it back with some coppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
inside, so that the recipient should have to pay eightpence on
receipt of it, and the whole school was told of his action. One
day there was a by-election going on hard-by. All the school
were taken with blue ribbons on their jackets except the unfortunate
seven Liberals, who were told to stay at home and
work.</p>

<p>One year Mr. Joseph Chamberlain was burnt in effigy, as
he was then a Radical, and the effigy held in its hands a
large cardboard cow with three acres written on it. It was a
bad time for the Liberals, as the foreign policy of the Liberal
Government was at that time particularly weak, and it was
impossible to defend Mr. Gladstone’s Egyptian policy, still less
Lord Granville. So the Head smiled in triumph over the
renegades, one of whom I am glad to say was Basil Blackwood.
He took the matter very calmly and drew offensive caricatures
of the Conservative politicians.</p>

<p>During the summer the rage the boys had for keeping
caterpillars in breeding cages, for collecting butterflies, and
keeping live stock was allowed full play. The Head himself had
supplies of live animals brought to the school, among which
were salamanders and Italian snakes. I myself invested in a
green lizard, which although it had no tail, was in other respects
satisfactory, and ate, so a letter of mine of that date says, a lot
of worms. I also had a large, fat toad, which was blind in one
eye, but for a toad, affectionate. But the ideal of the boys was
to possess a Natterjack toad, whatever that may mean or be.
We were allowed to go out on the heath during the summer
and catch small lizards and butterflies, and altogether natural
history was encouraged; so was gardening. Boys who wished
to do so might have a garden, and a prize was offered for the
garden which was the prettiest and the best kept throughout
the summer term. I won that prize. My garden contained
four rose trees, several geraniums, some cherry pie, and a border
of lobelias. It was a conventional garden, but there was a
professional touch about it, and I tended it with infinite care.
The prize was a ball of string in an apple made of Lebanon
wood. Sometimes we were allowed into the strawberry beds,
and could eat as many strawberries as we liked. During
this term I made great friends with Broadwood. We were
both in the third division, and decided that we would
write a pantomime together some day. One day we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
looking on at a cricket match which was being played against
another school. I have told what happened in detail elsewhere
in the form of a story, but the sad bare facts were these.
The school was getting beaten, the day was hot, the match was
long and tedious, and Broadwood and another boy called Bell
and myself wandered away from the match; two of us climbed
up the wooden platform, which was used for letting off fireworks
on the 5th of November. Bell remained below, and we threw
horse-chestnuts at him, which he caught in his mouth. Presently
one of the masters advanced towards us, biting his
knuckles, which he did when he was in a great rage, and
glowered. He ordered us indoors, and gave us two hours’ work
to do in the third division schoolroom. We went in as happy
as larks, and glad to be in the cool. But at tea we saw there
was something seriously amiss. The rival eleven who had beaten
us were present, but not a word was spoken. There was an
atmosphere of impending doom over the school charged with
the thunder of a coming row. After tea, when the guests had
gone, the school was summoned into the hall, and the Head,
gowned and frowning, addressed us, and accused the whole
school in general, and Broadwood, Bell, and myself in particular,
of want of patriotism, bad manners, inattention, and
vulgarity. He was disgusted, he said, with the behaviour of
the school before strangers. We were especially guilty, but
the whole school had shown want of attention, and gross
callousness and indifference to the cricket match (which was
all too true), and consequently had tarnished the honour of the
school. There was to have been an expedition to the New
Forest next week. That expedition would not come off; in fact,
it would never come off; and the speech ended and the school
trooped out in gloomy silence and broke up into furtive
whispering groups. That night in my cubicle I said to
Worthington that I thought Campbell minor, who had been
scoring during the match, had certainly behaved well all
day, and didn’t he deserve to go to the New Forest? “No,”
said Worthington; “he whistled twice.” “Oh,” I said, “then
of course he can’t go.”</p>

<p>But the choir had an expedition that term, nevertheless.
We went to Shanklin in the Isle of Wight, where we bathed in
the sea and got back after midnight.</p>

<p>My mother took my sister Elizabeth to the Ascot races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that year. Elizabeth was just out, and they came and fetched
me and took me too, as boys were allowed to go to the races. A
little later another drama happened, in which I was unwillingly
to play the chief part. We were all playing on the heath one
morning, and I had just found a lizard and was utterly absorbed
in this find when I got a summons that I was wanted by
the Head. I found the Head in the Masters’ Common Room
enjoying a little collation. It was half-past ten. “A telegram
has come,” said the Head, “that you have been especially invited
to a children’s garden-party at Marlborough House by the
Princess of Wales, and you are to go up to London at once.
Are you,” said the Head ironically, “a special friend of the
Princess of Wales?” Half excited, half fearful, and not
without forebodings, I changed into my best clothes, and ran
off to catch the train. I was to come back that evening. I
arrived in time for luncheon, and after luncheon went to the
garden-party with Hugo, where we spent a riotous afternoon.
There were performing dogs and many games. My father was
not there. He was in Devonshire. When we got home it was
found that I had missed the train I was supposed to go back by,
and my mother thought I had better stay the night. She sent
off a telegram to the Head, and asked if I might do so. I
thought this was a rash act. The answer came back just before
dinner that if I did not come back that night I was not to come
back at all. Everyone was distraught. There was only one
more train, which did not get to Ascot till half-past twelve.</p>

<p>My mother was incensed with the Headmaster, and said if
my father was there she knew he would not let me go back. I
remained neutral in the general discussion and absolutely
passive, while my fate hung in the balance, but I wanted to go
back, on the whole. Both courses seemed quite appalling: to
go back after such an adventure, or not to go, and face a new
school. At first it was settled that on no account should I go,
but finally it was settled that I should go. D. took me. We
arrived late. There were no flys at the station and we had
to walk to the school. We did not get there till half-past one in
the morning. D. said she would sleep at the hotel, but the
matron who opened the door for us insisted on giving her a bedroom.
The next morning I got up at half-past six to practise
the pianoforte, as usual, and D. looked into the room and said
good-bye, and then I felt I had to begin to live down this appalling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
episode. But to my surprise it was not alluded to. The
truth being, as I afterwards found out, that not only my father
and mother, but Dr. Warre of Eton, had written to the Headmaster
to tell him he had behaved foolishly, and shortly afterwards,
to make amends, I was sent up to London to the dentist.
But oh, parents, dear parents, if you only knew what stress of
mind such episodes involve, you would not insist on such
favours, nor ever forward invitations of that kind, not even at
the bidding of the King.</p>

<p>D. paid me one other visit while I was at Ascot, and
brought with her a large bunch of white grapes from Sheppy.
We were not allowed hampers, nor were we allowed to eat any
food brought by strangers or relations in the house, and when I
saw that bunch of white grapes I was terrorstruck. I made
D. hide it at once. I was afraid that even its transient presence
in the house might be discovered, nor did I eat one grape.</p>

<p>I cannot remember that summer holiday, unless it was that
summer we went to Contrexéville for the second time, but
when I went back to school in September, Hugo went with
me and we shared the same room. Games of Spankaboo
went on every night. During all my schooltime at Ascot
I have already said that I was never once bullied by the
boys, but I never seemed to do right either in the eyes of the
Headmaster or of the Second Division master. The two
other masters were friendly. These two masters, we were
one day informed, intended to leave the school and set up a
school of their own at Eastbourne. They were both of them
friendly to Hugo and myself. The school was to subscribe and
give them a bacon dish in Sheffield plate as a parting gift. One
day I wrote home and suggested that Hugo and I should go to
that school. I did not think this request would be taken
seriously. It seemed to me quite fantastic—an impossible, wild
fancy. To my intense surprise no answer explaining how impossible
such a thing was arrived, and I forget what happened
next, but I know that soon the two departing masters discussed
the matter with me, and I found out they were actually
in correspondence with my mother. The remaining masters used
to scowl at us, but the term ended calmly and we left the day
before the end of the term, so I was unable to play in the treble
in a piece for three people at one pianoforte called “Marche
Romaine,” which I was down for on the concert programme, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
second time I missed performing at a concert in public, and the
opportunity of a lifetime missed. When I got to Membland I
found it was settled that we were not going back to Ascot, but
to the new school, St. Vincent’s, at Eastbourne. The Headmaster
was told, and he at first accepted the matter calmly,
but a little later he wrote to my father and asked him what
reasons he had for taking his sons away if other parents asked
him. My father seldom wrote a letter of more than one page.
But on that occasion he wrote a letter of four pages, and the
Head wrote back to say that he was entirely satisfied with his
reasons. My mother and I always wondered what was in that
letter. My father when asked said: “I knew what the man
wanted to know, and I told him,” but we never knew what
that was.</p>

<p>In January Hugo and I went to Eastbourne, and my friend,
Broadwood, also left Ascot and followed us. There were only
nine boys at first. But the next term there were, I think,
twenty, then thirty, and soon the school became almost as big
as the Ascot school, where there were forty boys.</p>

<p>Before I left Eastbourne, the Headmaster of my first school
died, and I do not know what happened to the school afterwards.
Several of the Ascot boys came to Eastbourne later,
but the boys at Ascot were not allowed to correspond with us.
My cousins, Rowland and Windham Baring, arrived, the sons
of my Uncle Mina, who was afterwards Lord Cromer.</p>

<p>At Eastbourne a new life began. There was more amusement
than work about it, and everything was different. We
played Soccer with another school; we went to the swimming
bath, and I learnt to swim; to a gymnasium, and we were drilled
by a volunteer sergeant. Broadwood and I gave theatrical performances,
one of which represented the Headmaster’s ménage
at our first school. It must have been an amusing play to watch,
as the point of it was that the Ascot Headmaster discovered his
wife kissing her brother, another of the Ascot masters, the villain,
and she sang a song composed by Broadwood and myself, of
which the refrain was, “What would Herbert say, dear—what
would Herbert say?” Herbert being the Ascot Headmaster.
Herbert then broke on to the scene and gave way to paroxysms
of jealous rage. Another boy who came to this school was
Pierre de Jaucourt, the son of Monsieur de Jaucourt, a great
friend of my father’s. Pierre was one of the playfellows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
my childhood. He took part in the dramatic performances
organised by Broadwood and myself in the Boot Room, which
became more and more ambitious, and in one play the Devil
appeared through a trap-door in a cloud of fire.</p>

<p>Broadwood and I were constantly making up topical duets
modelled on those of Harry Nicholls and Herbert Campbell in
the Drury Lane pantomime. But we were not satisfied with
these scratch performances in the Boot Room, although we had
a make-up box from Clarkson, and wigs, and we decided to
act <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, which was at once put into rehearsal.
I was cast for the part of Mr. Hardcastle, Hugo for that of
Miss Hastings, Broadwood for that of Marlowe, Bell for that of
Miss Hardcastle, and an overgrown boy called Pyke-Nott for
the part of Tony Lumpkin. After a few rehearsals it was
settled that the play should be done on a real stage, and that
parents and others should be invited to witness the performance.
Dresses were made for us in London, scenery was painted by
Mr. Shelton, our drawing-master, and my father and mother
came down to see the play.</p>

<p>Hugo looked a vision of beauty as Miss Hastings. Pyke-Nott
was annoyed because he was not allowed to sing a song
about Fred Archer in the tavern scene, instead of the real song
which is a part of the text. It was thought that a song of which
the refrain was, “Archer, Archer up,” would be an anachronism.</p>

<p>The play went off very well, and Hugo played a breakdown
on the banjo between the acts, but when he had played three
bars the bridge of his banjo fell with a crash, and the solo came
to an end.</p>

<p>We kept up the custom of going expeditions, not long
ones, but only to places like Pevensey and Hurstmonceux,
which were quite close. We also went out riding with a riding-master
on the Downs, and in the summer we sailed in sailing
boats. Altogether it was an ideal school life. We found the
work easy, and we all seemed to get quantities of prizes, but we
learnt little. Hugo and I continued to play Spankaboo in our
room, and Hugo would do anything in the world if I threatened
to refuse to play. So much so, that one of the masters thought
I was blackmailing him, and we were told to reveal our strange
secret at once. This we both resolutely refused to do, protesting
with tears that it was a private matter of no importance,
and there the matter was allowed to rest, the master merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
saying that if he ever saw any signs of anything subterranean
going on we should be punished.</p>

<p>I remember one curious episode happening. One of the
masters found a letter addressed to one of the boys written to
him by another boy. This was the text of the letter: “Dear
Mister C.,—May I have my sausage next Sunday at breakfast
because I am very hungry.”</p>

<p>Mr. C., it was discovered, had been regularly levying a tribute
from his neighbour at breakfast for some weeks, and the other
boy, a much smaller boy, had had to go without his sausage.
Mr. C. was severely flogged in front of the whole school.
Boys who went to Scotland for the holidays were allowed to
leave a day before the others, and as we had an all day’s journey
to Devonshire, we shared the same privilege; so did Pierre de
Jaucourt, who went to France. This inspired Broadwood to
make the following lampoon, which was good-naturedly but
insistently chanted by the rest of the school on the day before
we went away:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Honourables are going away to-morrow,</div>
<div class="verse">And ten to one the Count goes too.</div>
<div class="verse">We poor swinies we don’t go,</div>
<div class="verse">We poor swinies we don’t go.</div>
<div class="verse">The Honourables are going away to-morrow,</div>
<div class="verse">And ten to one the Count goes too.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we went home for the holidays for the first time from
Eastbourne the train stopped at Slough. The St. Vincent’s
term had ended a few days before the Ascot term, and there,
on the platform of Slough Station, we saw the Headmaster
of our Ascot school, surrounded by the first division and
evidently enjoying a first division expedition.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put your head out and say how do you
do to them?” said my mother, but Hugo and I almost hid
under the seat, and we lay right back from the windows, spellbound,
till the train went on.</p>

<p>Broadwood and I used to meet in the holidays in London.
Broadwood used to say to his parents that he was having
luncheon with me in Charles Street, and I used to say I was
having luncheon with Broadwood in Eccleston Square, but
what really happened was that we used to go to a bun shop,
or have no luncheon at all, as neither of us would be seen at
luncheon with a friend in each other’s homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Broadwood said that his mother cross-questioned him about
our house, and that he gave a most fantastic account of our
mode of life.</p>

<p>While we were at school at Eastbourne many eventful
things happened at home. In the summer holidays of 1886,
Hugo and I went with my father to the Cowes Regatta.</p>

<p>In September of the same year my father, Hugo, and myself
went for a long cruise in the <i>Waterwitch</i>. We started from
Membland and stopped at Falmouth, and Mounts Bay, and
saw over St. Michael’s Mount, and then we sailed to the Scilly
Isles, where we spent a day in the wonderful garden of Tresco.
At that time of year the sea in the Scilly Isles was as blue as the
Mediterranean, especially when seen through the fuchsia hedges
and the almost tropical vegetation of the Tresco gardens. We
then sailed across the Irish Channel to Bantry Bay and up the
Kenmare River and drove in an Irish car right across the
mountains to Killarney.</p>

<p>Next year was Jubilee year. Both my eldest sisters were
married that year. Hugo and I attended these weddings and
the Jubilee procession as well, which we saw from Bath House,
Piccadilly, but I don’t remember much about it, except the
Queen’s bonnet, which had diamonds in front of it, and the
German Crown Prince in his white uniform, but I remember the
aspect of London before and after the Jubilee, the Venetian
masts, the flags, the crowds, the carriages, the atmosphere
of festivity, and the jokes about the Jubilee.</p>

<p>We went on acting a French play every year at Christmas,
and it was before Margaret was married that we had our greatest
success with a little one-act play by Dumas fils called <i>Comme
Elles sont Toutes</i>, in which Margaret and Susan did the chief
parts quite admirably, and in which I had a minor part. This
was performed at Christmas 1886. After Elizabeth and
Margaret were married, Susan and I and Hugo continued to
act, and we did three plays in all: <i>Les Rêves de Marguerite</i>
(1887); <i>La Souris</i> (1888); <i>l’Amour de l’Art</i> (by Labiche) (1889).</p>

<p>Another home excitement was the building of an organ
in the house in Charles Street. It was by way of being a
small organ at first, but it afterwards expanded into quite a
respectable size, and had three manuals. This gave me a mania
for everything to do with organs. I got to know every detail
in the process of organ-building and every device, tubular-pneumatic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and otherwise. The organ we had at Membland
had been built by Mr. Hele of Plymouth, and when we went
back to Membland, when the organ was being built in London,
my mother said: “Don’t say anything to Mr. Hele about this,
as he will be hurt at our not having employed him.” One day
Mr. Hele came to tune the organ, and I disappeared with him,
as was my wont, right under the staircase into the very entrails
of the organ and watched him at his work. While we were
there in the darkness and the confined space, I confessed to him
the secret that we were having an organ built in London.
When we came out he went straight to my mother and said that
Messrs. Hele would have been only too glad to build an organ
in London. When my mother asked me how I could have told
Mr. Hele we were having an organ built in London, I said I
thought that as we were right inside the organ, in the dark
and in such a narrow space, that it wouldn’t matter, and that he
would forget. When my mother told Chérie of this episode,
Chérie laughed more than I ever saw her laugh, and I couldn’t
understand why; I was, in fact, a little offended.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">ETON</span></h2>

<p>I enjoyed Eton from the first moment I arrived. The
surprise and the relief at finding one was treated like
a grown-up person, that nobody minded if one had a
sister called Susan or not, that all the ridiculous petty conventions
of private-school life counted for nothing, were inexpressibly
great.</p>

<p>Directly I arrived I was taken up to my tutor in his study,
which was full of delightful books. He took me to the matron,
Miss Copeman, whom we called MeDame. I was then shown
my room, a tiny room on the second floor in one of the houses
opposite to the school-yard. As I sat in my room, boy after
boy strolled in, and instead of asking one idiotic questions
they carried on rational conversation.</p>

<p>The next day I met Broadwood, who was at another house,
and we walked up to Windsor in the afternoon. He told me
all the things I had better know at once; such as not to walk
on the wrong side of the street when one went up town; never
to roll up an umbrella or to turn down the collar of one’s greatcoat;
how to talk to the masters and how to talk of them;
what shops to go to, and what were the sock-shops that no
self-respecting boy went to. There were several such which I
never entered the whole time I was at Eton, and yet I suppose
they must have been patronised by someone.</p>

<p>The day after that came the entrance examination, in
which I did badly indeed, only taking Middle Fourth. My tutor
said: “You have been taught nothing at all.” I was in the
twenty-seventh division—the last division of the school but
three, and up to Mr. Heygate. I was in the French division
of M. Hua, who directly he put me on to read saw that I knew
French, a fact which I had concealed during the whole time I
was at my first private school. I messed with Milton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Herbert Scott, and after the first fortnight I became one of
the two fags apportioned to Heywood-Lonsdale.</p>

<p>The captain of the House was Charlie Wood, Lord Halifax’s
eldest son, and his younger brother, Francis, was a contemporary
of mine and in the same house, but Francis, who was the most
delightful of boys and the source and centre of endless fun, died
at Eton in the Lent half of 1889.</p>

<p>Fagging was a light operation. One had to make one’s
fagmaster tea, two pieces of toast, and sometimes boil some
eggs, show that one’s hands were clean, and that was all. Then
one was free to cook buttered eggs or fry sausages for one’s
own tea.</p>

<p>On my first Sunday at Eton I had breakfast with Arthur
Ponsonby, who was at Cornish’s, and I was invited to luncheon
at Norman Tower, Windsor, where the Ponsonbys lived. There
I found my Uncle Henry, my Aunt M’aimée, my cousins, Betty
and Maggie and Johnny, and the Mildmay boys, who were also
at Eton then.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went for a walk in the private grounds
of the Home Park with Johnny, and he took us to a grotto called
the Black Hole of Calcutta, which was supposed to represent
the exact dimensions of that infamous prison. It had a small,
thick, glazed glass window at the top of it. On the floor was a
heap of stones. Johnny suggested our throwing stones at the
window, and soon a spirited stone-throwing competition began.
The window was already partly shattered when warning was
given that someone was coming. We thought it might be
the Queen, and we darted out of the grotto and ran for our
lives.</p>

<p>The whole of my Eton life was starred with these Sundays
at the Norman Tower, which I looked forward to during the
whole week. Maggie would take us sometimes into the Library
and the State Rooms, and we used sometimes to hear the approaching
footsteps of some of the Royal Family, and race for
our life through the empty rooms.</p>

<p>One day we came upon the Empress Frederick, who was
quietly enjoying the pictures by herself.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the afternoon Betty would take me up to her
room and read out books to me, but that was later.</p>

<p>Our house played football with Evans’, Radcliffe’s, and
Ainger’s. We had to play four times a week, and though I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
always a useless football player, I thoroughly enjoyed these
games, especially the changing afterwards (when we roasted
chestnuts in the fire as we undressed), and the long teas.
Milton, my mess-mate, was an enthusiastic, but not a skilful
chemist, and one day he blew off his eyebrows while making
an experiment.</p>

<p>At the end of my first half we had a concert in the house,
in which I took part in the chorus. I had organ lessons from
Mr. Clapshaw, and during my first half I once had the treat of
hearing Jimmy Joynes preach in Lower Chapel. He had been
lower master for years, and had just left Eton; he came down
to pay a visit, and this was the last time he ever preached at
Eton. His sermons were of the anecdotal type, full of quaint,
pathetic, and dramatic stories of the triumph of innocence.
They were greatly enjoyed by the boys. In the evening, after
prayers, my tutor used to come round the boys’ rooms and talk
to every boy. He used to come into the room saying: “Qu’est-ce
que c’est que ci que ça?” My friends were Dunglass, Herbert
Scott, Milton, Stewart, and Brackley. After Eton days I never
saw Stewart again till 1914, when the war had just begun. I
met him then in Paris. He was in the Intelligence. He had
been imprisoned in Germany before the war, and he was killed
one day while riding through the town of Braisne on the Aisne.</p>

<p>Dunglass was peculiarly untidy in his clothes, and his hat
was always brushed round the wrong way. My tutor used to
say to him: “You’re covered with garbage from head to foot,”
and sometimes to me: “If your friends and relations could see
you now they would have a fit.”</p>

<p>In the evenings the Lower boys did their work in pupil room.
Boys in fifth form, when they were slack, did the same as a
punishment, and this was called penal servitude. While they
prepared their lessons or did their verses, my tutor would be
taking older boys in what was called <i>private</i>; this in our case
meant special lessons in Greek. One night these older boys
were construing Xenophon, and a boy called Rashleigh could
not translate the phrase, “Τοὺς πρὸς ἐμὲ λέγοντας.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> My tutor
repeated it over and over again, and then appealed to us Lower
boys. I knew what it meant, but when I was asked I repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
exactly what Rashleigh had said, like one hypnotised, much to
my tutor’s annoyance.</p>

<p>Sometimes when my tutor was really annoyed he would say:
“Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and think what
a ghastly fool you are?” Another time he said to a boy:
“You’ve no more manners than a cow, and a <i>bad</i> cow, too.”
When the word δύναμαι occurred in Greek, my tutor made a
great point of distinguishing the pronunciation of δύναμ<span class="u">αι</span> and
δυνάμει. δύναμ<span class="u">αι</span> he pronounced more broadly. When we
read out the word δύναμαι we made no such distinction, and he
used to say, “Do you mean <i>dunamẏ</i> or <i>dunam<span class="u">ai</span></i>?” It was our
great delight to draw this expression from him, and whenever
the word δύναμαι occurred we were careful to accent the last
syllable as slightly as possible. It never failed.</p>

<p>We did verses once a week. A little later most of these
were done in the house by a boy called Malcolm, who had
the talent for dictating verses, on any subject, while he was
eating his breakfast, with the necessary number of mistakes
and to the exact degree of badness needed for the
standard of each boy, for if they were at all too good my tutor
would write on them, “Who is the poet?” In return for this
I did the French for him and a number of other boys. Latin
verses both then, and until I left Eton, were the most important
event of the week’s work. When one’s verses had been done
and signed by one’s tutor one gave a gasp of relief. Sometimes
he tore them up and one had to do them again. I was a
bad writer of Latin verse. The kind of mistakes I made
exasperated my tutor to madness, especially when I ventured
on lyrics which he implored me once never to attempt again.
In spite of the trouble verses gave one, even when they were
partly done by someone else, one preferred doing them to a long
passage of Latin prose, which was sometimes a possible alternative.
It is a strange fact, but none the less true, that boys can
acquire a mechanical facility for doing Latin verse of a kind,
with the help of a gradus, without knowing either what the
English or the Latin is about.</p>

<p>The subjects given for Latin verse, what we called <i>sense</i> for
verses, were sometimes amusing. The favourite subject from
the boys’ point of view was Spring. It was a favourite subject
among the masters, too. It afforded opportunities for innumerable
clichés, which were easy to find. One of the masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
giving out sense for verses used to say: “This week we will do
verses”—and then, as if it were something unheard of—“on
Spring. Take down some hints. The grass is green,
sheep bleat, sound of water is heard in the distance—might
perhaps get in <i>desilientis aquæ</i>.”</p>

<p>The same master said one day, to a boy who had done some
verses on Charles <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>, “<i>Castus et infelix</i> is hardly an appropriate
epithet for Charles <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>” Once we had a lyric on a toad. “Avoid
the gardener, a dangerous man,” was one of the hints which I
rendered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fas tibi sit bufo custodem fallere agelli.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole of my first half was like Paradise, and I came back
to Membland for the holidays quite radiant.</p>

<p>When I went back for my second half I was in the Upper
Fourth in the Lower Master’s Division. The Lower Master was
Austen Leigh and the boys called him the Flea. I started,
when I was up to him, the fiction that I could scarcely write,
that the process was so difficult to me that a totally illegible
script was all that could be expected from me. This was
completely successful throughout the half, but in Trials I did
well. I had started off by getting the holiday task prize,
the holiday task being the <i>Lord of the Isles</i>, and as I had read a
great part of it in the train going back, and as none of the other
boys had read any of it, I got the prize.</p>

<p>Those holidays Chérie took Susan and myself to Paris. We
stayed at the Hôtel Normandy in the Rue de l’Échelle, and I
started from Eton the day before the result of Trials was declared.
The day we arrived in Paris a blue telegram came
telling us the result. It ran as follows: “Brinkman divinity
prize, distinction in Trials, Trial Prize.” This meant that for
the distinction, one had a cross next to one’s name in the school
list for the rest of one’s Eton career. The Trial prize meant
one was first in Trials in the division. It was a complete
triumph, and the Lower Master wrote in my report: “Had I
known what I discovered at the end of the half that he could
write perfectly well, I would have torn up every scrap of his
work during the half.” But it was an idle regret, as he did not
discover it until too late. We spent the whole of the holidays
in Paris and enjoyed it wildly.</p>

<p>Looking at a letter which I wrote from Paris (March 1888)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at this time, I see we did some strenuous sight-seeing. We
went to Notre Dame des Victoires, to the Musée Grévin, to
Sainte Geneviève, la Foire de Jambon, the Jardin d’Acclimatation,
and the Bois de Boulogne; we breakfasted at the
Café de Paris, with anisette at the end of the meal; went to
hear “la Belle musique sacrée” at the Châtelet, where Mademoiselle
Kraus sang and Mounet Sully recited; we visited
the Panthéon, saw Victor Hugo’s tomb, the Musée Cluny;
had breakfast at Foyod’s, and saw the Archbishop of Paris
officiate at Notre Dame, and went to the Louvre. All this was
in Holy Week.</p>

<p>The next week we went to Versailles, the Sainte Chapelle,
and the Invalides; saw Reichemberg and Samary act in the
<i>Le Monde ou l’on s’ennuie</i> at the Théâtre français and <i>Michel
Strogoff</i> at the Châtelet.</p>

<p>On Monday, 2nd April, I wrote home: “Nous allons jeter une
plume et la suivre.” We also saw a play of Georges Ohnet’s at
the Porte Saint Martin called <i>La Grande Marnière</i> and <i>Le Prophète</i>
at the opera, with Jean de Reske singing the part of the false
Messiah. We saw this from a little box high up in the fourth tier,
and when we arrived we found a lady and a gentleman in our
seats. We had expressly paid for the front seats. Chérie was
indignant, and had it out with the gentleman, who gave way
under protest. “Vous voyez,” said the lady, “Monsieur vous
cède sa place.” “C’est ce qu’un Monsieur doit faire,” said Chérie.
“On rencontre des gens,” said the lady, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>We did not go to see <i>L’Abbé Constantin</i>, as Chérie said it
was “<i>une pièce de carême</i>.”</p>

<p>On our last night in Paris we went to see a farce called
<i>Cocart et Bicoquet</i> at the Renaissance. This play had been
recommended to Chérie by a French friend of hers, who thought
we did not understand French enough to follow dialogue.
After the first act, Chérie became uneasy, and no sooner was
the second act well under way than Chérie took us away. It
was, she said to me, no play for Susan. She added that whenever
she had tried to distract Susan’s attention from the more
scabrous moments by saying, “Regarde cette manche,” and
by calling her attention to interesting details in the toilettes of
the audience, I had recalled Susan’s attention to the play by
my only too well-timed laughter.</p>

<p>The year after this, 1889, we again went to Paris—Chérie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Susan, and myself—and this year Hugo came with us. Great
preparations were being made for the Exhibition. It was not
yet open, but the Eiffel Tower was finished, and we saw the
reconstruction of the <i>Le Vieux Paris</i> and a representation of
Latude escaping from the Bastille.</p>

<p>We also saw <i>Maître Guérin</i> performed at the Théâtre
français, with Got Worms, Baretta, and Pierson in the cast.
Got’s performance as the old, infinitely cunning, and scheming
<i>notaire</i>, who is finally deserted by his hitherto submissive
wife, was said to be the finest thing he ever did.</p>

<p>We saw two melodramas—<i>Robert Macaire</i> and <i>La Porteuse
de Pain; Zampa</i> at the Opéra Comique and <i>Belle Maman</i>,
Sardou’s comedy at the Gymnase; and Chérie and I went to see
Sarah Bernhardt in perhaps the worst play to which she ever
lent her incomparable genius, and which, I imagine, she chose
simply to give herself the opportunity of playing a quiet death
scene. It was an adaptation of the English novel, <i>As in a
Looking-Glass</i>. Bad or good, I enjoyed it, and wrote home a
detailed criticism of the play. This is what I wrote: “The
adaptation of the book is bad. They evidently think you are
perfectly acquainted with the book, and the sharp outline and
light and shade of character is not sufficiently marked. In the
first act you see about a dozen people who come in and who
don’t let you know who they are, and who never appear again,
and you do not arrive at the dramatic part till the last act.</p>

<p>“The story is briefly thus: Léna is staying with Mrs.
Broadway, very <i>Sainte Nitouche!</i> everyone admiring her and
all the <i>octogenaires</i> in love with her. She (whose <i>passé</i> is not
<i>sans tache</i>) is under the power of a certain Jack Fortinbras,
who forces her, under the penalty of unveiling her past, to
marry a certain Lord Ramsey. Léna has in her possession a
letter which Ramsey wrote to a Lady Dower, whose name is
also Léna, and the letter is in very affectionate terms. Ramsey
is engaged to Beatrice, and Léna shows this letter to Beatrice
and says it was to her! Of course, Beatrice thinks Ramsey
<i>un lâche</i> and leaves the house, saying her marriage is impossible,
and leaving a letter for Ramsey to that effect. Act II.
is in Léna’s house. Fortinbras comes and plays cards with a
young man and cheats. Ramsey sees this, and Fortinbras
is turned out of the house.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Act III.</span>, <i>Monte Carlo</i>.—Léna is staying there with Ramsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with whom she is now desperately in love. Fortinbras appears
and asks for money, which she gives. Ramsey comes in and
asks why she is agitated. She says she is helpless, alone. He
confesses his love for her, and she, in a nervous excitement,
says, “Je t’adore,” and so scheming to marry for money, she
finds she is dreadfully in love with him.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Act IV.</span>—They are married and in Scotland. Fortinbras
appears tracked by detectives and asks for 200,000 (pounds or
francs?) at once, or he tells of her <i>passé</i>. Then Sarah Bernhardt
was superb. It was quite impossible for her to get the money,
and she is so happy with her husband. At this crisis Ramsey
comes in and half strangles Fortinbras, who, when let go,
reveals all Léna’s past. At the words, ‘Cette femme m’aimait
une fois,’ Léna <i>jette un cri d’angoisse</i>, I would have given anything
for you to have seen her act that scene. Ramsey hears
it all, and, when given the proofs that are in letters, throws
them into the fire, and Fortinbras is given to the detectives and
Ramsey is alone with Léna and tells her that he really believes
what the man said. She cannot deny it, and confesses the
whole thing. Her acting was supreme, and Ramsey says to
her, ‘Et m’avez vous jamais aimé?’ Then she gives way and
bursts into <i>sanglots</i>, and implores him to believe her, and that
she adored him. He refuses to believe her and goes out. Then
all is pantomime. She takes up a knife, throws it down, gets a
little bottle of ‘morphine,’ drinks it, sits down with Ramsey’s
photograph in her hand; then come seven minutes of silence.
All pantomime, but what pantomime; she quietly dies. I
have never seen such a splendid bit of acting. It was lovely.
As she is dying, Ramsey tries to come in, but the door is locked.
He comes in at the window in an agony of grief and forgives
her. Just when he is at the door she stretches out her hand
and falls back <i>épuisée</i>. It was beautiful.”</p>

<p>I remember a doctor saying, as we went out of the theatre:
“Mais ce n’est pas comme cela qu’on meurt de la morphine,”—upon
which someone else answered: “Alors, ceux qui ont dit:
Voilà une mort réaliste ont dit une sottise. Pourtant elle a
été dite.”</p>

<p>We went to the cemetery of the Père Lachaise, and the tombs
that I cited in a letter are those of Héloïse and Abelard, Balzac,
Alfred de Musset, Bizet, and Géricault.</p>

<p>I went back to Eton for my first summer half, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
said to be the most blissful moment of Eton life, and I
think in my case it was. The first thing one had to do was
to pass swimming. I had learnt to swim at Eastbourne, and I
swam as well as I ever did before or afterwards, but to pass,
one had to swim in a peculiar way. The passing was supervised
by my tutor, and I failed to pass twice, chiefly, I think,
owing to the curious nature of my dive from the boat, which
took the form of a high leap into the air and a descent on all-fours
into the water. “Swim to the bank,” said my tutor,
much to my disappointment. The second time I failed again,
but there was soon a third trial, and I passed. I at once hired
an outrigged gig with another boy, and then a period of unmixed
enjoyment began: rows up to Surley every afternoon and
ginger-beer in the garden there, bathes in the evening at
Cuckoo Weir, teas at Little Brown’s, where one ordered new
potatoes and asparagus, or cold salmon and cucumber, gooseberries
and cream, raspberries and cream, and every fresh
delicacy of the season in turn. Little Brown’s, the school
sock-shop next to Ingalton Drake’s, the stationer’s, which we
still called Williams’, was then controlled by Brown, who was
a comfortable lady rather like the pictures of the Queen of
Hearts in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. She was assisted by Phœbe,
who kept order with great spirit, in a seething mass of unruly
boys, all shouting at the top of their voices and clamouring to
be served first. Brown’s was open before early school, and if
one had the energy, one got up in time to go and have a coffee
and a bun there. It was well worth the effort, for the buns
were slit open and filled with butter, and then, not toasted, but
baked in the oven, and were crisp, hot, and delicious. Brown
and Phœbe had the most marvellous memory for faces I
have ever come across. They would remember a boy years
afterwards, and when I was at Eton I used often to hear Brown
say to Phœbe, as some very middle-aged man passed the
window, “There’s Mr. So-and-so.”</p>

<p>There was a pandemonium in the front of the shop; in
the little room at the back of the shop only swells went.
There was another sock-shop called Rowland’s, near Barnes
Pool, which had a garden and an arbour, and sold scalloped
prawns in winter and wonderful strawberry messes in the
summer. Then farther up town there was Califano, who was
celebrated for his fiery temper, and in Windsor there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Leighton’s. But Brown’s was the smallest and cosiest of all
the sock-shops, and nothing at any of the others could vie with
her hot buns in the early morning.</p>

<p>I was now in Remove, and once more under the tuition
of Mr. Heygate. We no longer translated Greek stories and
epigrams from the delightful collection called <i>Sertum</i>, which was
used in the Fourth Form. This book is now out of print, but
I fortunately possess a copy. It is a most delightful anthology
of short anecdotes and poems. On the other hand, we did
Sidgwick’s Greek exercises, a book of very short English stories,
which have to be translated into Greek. It is one of the most
charming books ever written, and even now I can read it when
I can’t read anything else.</p>

<p>I can’t remember what we read in school that half, but I
remember reading <i>Monte Cristo</i> out of school. My mother had
given me an illustrated edition of it on my birthday. On the
afternoon of a whole school day I was reading of Dantès’ escape
from the Chateau d’If, and I became oblivious of the passage
of time. The school clock chimed the quarters, but I heeded
them not. Just before the school hour was ended the boys’
maid came in and told me I was missing school. I flung away
my book and ran breathless to upper school, where I found the
boys just going out. I had missed school, an unheard-of thing
to do, which meant probably writing out endless exercises of
Bradley’s Latin prose. Each division had what was called a
Prepostor, a boy who kept a book in which he was supposed
to note all boys who were absent, and to find out if they were
staying out, which meant staying out of lessons, that is to say,
staying indoors on account of sickness, in which case the Dame
of the house had to sign a statement to that effect in the prepostor’s
book, and add also whether they were excused lessons;
if they were not excused lessons they had to do written work in
the house. On this day the prepostor had not noticed my
absence, nor had Mr. Heygate, and I joined the crowd of boys
running downstairs as if I had been there all the time.</p>

<p>There were two sorts of masters at Eton—those who could
keep order and those who couldn’t. With those who could,
there was never any question of ragging. Boys knew at once
what was impossible and accepted it. They also knew in a
moment when it was possible, and they lost no minute of their
opportunities, and at once began to harass the wretched master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with importunate, absurd, and impertinent questions, seeing how
far they could go in veiled insolence without overstepping the
line of danger. It was the masters who taught mathematics and
French who had the worst time, with the exception of Monsieur
Hua, who was an admirable teacher and stood no nonsense.</p>

<p>In Remove we did science. There were three science
masters—Mr. Porter, Mr. Drew, and Mr. Hale (Badger). I was
taught by them all in turn. Mr. Drew used to produce a
mysterious and rather dirty-looking bit of stony metal or metallic
stone, and say in a confidential whisper: “Do you know what
that is? It’s quartz.” Badger Hale had only one experiment.
It was a split football which was made to revolve by turning
a handle, and proved, but hardly to our satisfaction, the centrifugal
tendency of the earth. Mr. Porter’s science lectures, on the
other hand, were fraught with excitement. Apparatus after
apparatus was brought in, and experiment after experiment was
attempted, sometimes involving explosions. Sometimes they
failed. Sometimes, just at the critical moment we would laugh.
Mr. Porter would say: “I have been three days trying to get this
experiment ready, and now you have spoilt it all.” “Please,
sir, we were not laughing,” we would say. “You were looking
as if you were laughing, and that disturbs me just as much,”
Mr. Porter would answer. It was no use accusing us of laughing,
because we always denied it at once, and after a time he would
always say: “Write out the verbs in <i>mi</i> for looking as if you were
laughing.” At the end of the half, Mr. Porter gave what was
called a “Good Boys’ Lecture,” at which the first nine boys of
all the various sets he taught attended, if their work had been
satisfactory throughout the term. I went to three of these or
more. They were lectures with coloured magic-lantern slides,
showing views of places all over the world, from Indus to the
Pole. Never have I enjoyed anything more. There was a
slide of Vesuvius in eruption, and slides of Venice and New
Zealand, which were entrancingly beautiful. But one half, the
Good Boy Lecture was confined to Mr. Porter’s holiday trip to
the Isle of Skye, and the slides were not coloured. This lecture
was a disappointment, and I am afraid, from the boys’ point of
view, a failure. Another remarkable lecture Mr. Porter gave was
on soap-bubbles. Films of soap bubble were projected by some
device on to a screen, so that you saw the prismatic colours
enlarged and as vivid as rainbows. While this was going on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a boy called Harben, who had a fruity alto voice, sang a sentimental
song into a tube; the vibrations of the sound had a
strange effect on the soap-bubble films, and made them change
rapidly into a multitude of kaleidoscopic shapes and gyrations
and symmetrical patterns. So Mr. Porter was the precursor of
Skriabin’s Symphony, in which the music is assisted by visible
colour.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter gave a series of lectures on electricity out of
school. I and a boy in my house, Francis Egerton, applied
to go to these. Mr. Porter somewhat reluctantly and suspiciously
allowed us to come. They were rather stiff and advanced
lectures, involving a good deal of formula writing on the
blackboard with <i>pi</i> and other mysterious signs, but there were
also experiments. We did not understand one word of it,
but soon a difficult experiment was begun, which Mr. Porter
said had taken him days to prepare. He was doubtful whether
it would succeed. This was a rash remark. Egerton and I
rocked with laughter. We laughed till we cried. There was
no question of looking as if we were laughing. We were not
allowed to go to any more lectures on electricity. There was an
assistant masters’ prize given for science, and it was either that
or the following year that the subject was physiography. I went
in for this prize, staying out the whole Sunday before so as to
have time to read the book on which we were to be examined,
a short book by Huxley. I competed and won the prize. When
it came to choosing a book for my prize, I chose <i>The Epic of
Hades</i>, by Lewis Morris. I had to go to Mr. Cornish, who was
not yet Vice-Provost, to have my name written in it. He was
disgusted with my choice, and he advised me to change the
book. But I was obdurate. I had chosen the book for its nice
smooth binding, and nothing would make me reconsider my
decision. “It’s poor stuff,” said Mr. Cornish; “it’s like boys’
Latin verses when they’re very good.”</p>

<p>There were two other French masters besides M. Hua—M.
Roublot and M. Banck. M. Banck was sublimely strict, but M.
Roublot was easygoing, good-natured, but lacking in authority.
During his lesson we used to read the newspapers and write
our letters, but we liked him too much to rag. We used to bring
in all our occupations for the week, and stacks of writing-paper.
One day when this was happening, and every boy was pleasantly
but busily engaged in some occupation of his own, who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
walk in but the Headmaster, Dr. Warre. The newspapers and
the writing-paper and envelopes disappeared as by magic, and
M. Roublot at once put on the safest boy to construe. Dr.
Warre, who had grasped the situation, told us that our conduct
was disgraceful.</p>

<p>He often made sudden visits to divisions, and stood up by
the master’s desk while the work went on. These visits were
always alarming, and one day, when he had just gone out of
the room, one of the boys said: “Lord, how that man makes
me sweat!” But there was one other French master who was
not French, but far more formidable than all the rest, and
this was Mr. Frank Tarver. Mr. Tarver was a perfect French
scholar, and when he explained what the word <i>bock</i> meant,
and said: “When you go to a café in Paris you sit down and say,
‘Garçon, un bock,’” one felt that one had before one a perfect
man of the world. But sometimes there were no bounds to his
anger, especially if he found that one had not looked out words
in the dictionary, or if one translated <i>encore</i> by <i>again</i>. One day
I remember his being in such a passion that he took a drawer
from his desk and flung it on the ground. It is a great thing to
be able to do this effectually. The boys quaked. Most of us
liked him very much all the same; but to some he was a terror.</p>

<p>Mathematical lessons were always a difficulty in my case.
I should never have passed Trials in mathematics had it not been
for Euclid, which counted together with arithmetic and algebra.
Fortunately I could do Euclid without difficulty, so I always
got enough marks in that subject to make up for getting none
at all in the two other branches of the science.</p>

<p>Every week we had a task called an extra-work to do out
of school, which was meant to represent an hour’s work of mathematics,
and consisted of sums in arithmetic and algebra. It
generally took me more than an hour, and I never managed to
get a sum right. When we used to get into hopeless arrears
with our work, and everything was in an inextricable tangle,
there was always one solution, and that was to stay out; but
to be excused lessons one had to go to bed, and for that it was
necessary to catch cold. But just an ordinary attack of Friday
fever was enough to stay out. We complained of a bad headache
and incipient insomnia, and Miss Copeman let us stay out
at once, thinking it might be the beginning of measles, and we
sat in her sitting-room reading a novel till the crisis was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>At the slightest sign of a real streaming cold my tutor used
to pack us off to bed and keep us there till it was gone, and we
were allowed bound volumes of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>
from the boys’ library, and my tutor would lend us books from
his own library.</p>

<p>Each boy in a division had to be prepostor for the division
for a week at a time in turn. With the prepostor’s book one
marked in the boys who were absent, either from school or
chapel. One had a list of the boys’ names at the end of the
book and ticked them off as they walked into chapel. This
sounds a simple thing to do, but as the boys used to come in
at the last minute and all together, and one had to take up the
book to a master before chapel began, I found it flustering to a
degree, and never knew if I had marked everyone in or not. I
had to go to the Headmaster once for losing the prepostor’s
book, and he said I had played fast and loose with a position of
grave responsibility, and gave me three exercises of Bradley’s
Prose to write out.</p>

<p>After the summer half I was in Arthur Benson’s division.
We read passages from the <i>Odyssey</i>, Virgil, and Horace’s <i>Odes</i>,
the Second Book, and for the first time I enjoyed some Latin.
I thought Horace’s <i>Odes</i> delightful. Arthur Benson used to
make us draw pictures illustrating episodes in Greek history,
and he would stick them up on the wall if they were good.
One of the subjects suggested was the bridge of boats that
Xerxes threw across the sea, and I remember drawing a magnificent
picture, with the hills of the Chersonese in the background,
copied from some illustrations of the Crimean War, and
a realistic flat bridge made of planks placed on broad punts.
He was delighted with the picture and put it up at once, and
sometimes he used to take older boys to see it.</p>

<p>There was not much religious instruction at Eton. We
construed the Greek Testament on Monday mornings, but this
was a Greek lesson like any other; and Sunday was made
hideous by an exercise called Sunday Questions, which had to
be done on that day, and which we always put off doing to
the last possible moment. These were questions on historical
points in the Old Testament, and entailed finding out the
answers from some such book as Maclear’s <i>Old Testament
History</i>, and writing four large sheets of MSS. The questions
were sometimes puzzling, and we used to consult Miss Copeman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and sometimes, as a last resort, my tutor, who used to say:
“I can’t think what Mr. Benson”—or whoever it might be—“can
mean.” I have still got a copy of Sunday Questions
done at Eton. In this set we were told to give the probable
dates showing the duration of the kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, and what was going on in any other countries. Another
question is: “Why was Pharaoh Necho against Judah? How
did he treat their successive kings?” And the last question
(there were several others) was: “Distinguish carefully between
Jehoiakim and Jehoiakin.” I seem to have answered these
questions rather evasively, but I got seven marks out of ten.</p>

<p>Besides this, boys got their religion from the sermons in
Chapel, of which they were highly critical. They enjoyed a
good preacher, and some of the masters and guests were good
preachers, but the boys were merciless critics of a bad or ludicrous
preacher, and there were many of these. One of the
masters preached symbolic sermons about the meaning of the
Four Beasts. Another used to begin his sermons by saying:
“The story of the Prodigal Son is too well known to repeat.
We all know how⸺” and then elaborately retell what was
supposed to be too well known to tell at all. Before boys were
confirmed they received special tuition on religious and moral
topics from their tutor, but I missed it by having measles. So
I was confirmed in the holidays, and just before my confirmation
it struck my mother that I was singularly unprepared, so
she sent me to see my Uncle Henry Ponsonby’s brother, who
was a clergyman. We called him Uncle Fred; his sister had
married one of my uncles. He had a great sense of humour,
and was rather shy. He was also extremely High Church.
When I arrived with a note from my mother, in which he was
asked to examine me in theology, he was embarrassed, and he
said: “Well, I will ask you your catechism, What is your
name, N. or M.?” And then he laughed and said, “I think
that will do.” When I told my mother this, she sent me to
another clergyman who did talk, but confined the conversation
to moral generalities, and said no word about the catechism. So
I may say I had no religious instruction at school during all my
school-time, for which I have always been profoundly grateful.</p>

<p>Music lessons became a difficulty and a stumbling-block as
time went on. I had organ lessons, and they were, of course,
given out of school, and these lessons and the necessary practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
took up a lot of one’s spare time, besides having to give way to
work. Mr. Joseph Barnby, the organist and the head of the
music masters, said: “Your parents pay for your music
lessons just as they pay for your Latin lessons, and so you
ought to take just as much trouble about them.” This was
quite true, but the other masters did not see the matter in
the same light. They couldn’t be expected to take music
lessons seriously, and said that music must in all cases always
give way to work.</p>

<p>The result was one scamped one’s practice and shirked one’s
music lesson on every possible opportunity. Matters came to
such a pitch that I was sent for by Mr. Barnby. The situation
was aggravated because Dunglass and I had unwittingly offended
the violin master, and had gone into his room while he was giving
a lesson to another boy, and had then shut the door rather
more violently than was necessary. Mr. Barnby was indignant.
My brother John had been one of his best pupils. He said our
conduct was scandalous. I had employed base subterfuges to
shirk music lessons, and I and Dunglass had insulted dear kind
Mr. Morsh. We apologised to Mr. Morsh, and things went
more smoothly; but I gave up the organ and had lessons on the
pianoforte instead. Mr. Barnby was quite right, but he got no
sympathy from the other masters, who continued to treat music
as an utterly unimportant side issue which must give way to
everything else. The result being, of course, that directly boys
found that music lessons made it more difficult for them to get
through their work, they gave up learning music. I have never
stopped meeting people in after life who are naturally musical,
and bitterly regretted not having been taught music seriously as
boys; and if parents were wise they would insist on music being
taken seriously, if they pay for music lessons for their boys.
But as yet parents have done no such thing. Besides music
lessons, there was the musical society, which consisted of an
orchestra and a chorus, and performed a cantata at the school
concert at the end of the half. I belonged to this later, and we
sang Parry’s setting to Swinburne’s Eton “Ode” at the Eton
Tercentenary Concert in June 1891. Mr. Barnby used to conduct,
and had an amazing knack of discovering someone who was
not singing, or singing a wrong note. The concerts were, I used
to think, intensely enjoyable. There was an atmosphere of
triumph about them when the swells used to walk in at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
beginning in evening clothes, and coloured scarves, which stood
for various achievements either on the river, the cricket or the
football field. As each hero walked in there were thunders of
applause. Then a treble or an alto used to sing a song that
reduced the audience to tears: “Lay my head on your shoulder,
Daddy,” or “The Better Land.” There was a boy called
Clarke, who used to sing year after year till his voice broke. He
had a melting voice. During my last half at Eton there was a
boy called Herz, who sang “Si vous n’avez rien à me dire,”
with startling dramatic effect, exactly like a French professional.
But the best moment of all was when the Captain of the Boats
sang the solo in the Eton Boating Song, whether he had got a
voice or not, and then the whole school sang the “Carmen
Etonense” at the end. What an audience it was! How they
yelled and roared when a song pleased them! I used sometimes
to go to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor, and Sir Walter Parratt
used to let me sit in the organ loft. I heard Bach’s “Passion
Music of St. Matthew” in this way, and Sir Walter said:
“You must be as still as a mouse.”</p>

<p>I have said there were two kinds of masters: those who
were ragged and those who were not. The master who was
most ragged was a mathematical master called Mr. Mozley.
He punished, but could never stop the stream of impertinent
comment that went on through the hours of his instruction.
One day we got a boy called Studd to practise “God save the
Queen” at his open window. His window looked out on to a
yard, and Mr. Mozley’s schoolroom was on the ground floor of
the house next door to ours and looked out on to the same yard.
The windows were open. It was a hot summer’s afternoon, and
the strains of “God save the Queen” came in through Mr.
Mozley’s window. Every time the tune began we stood up.
“Sit down,” cried the Mo, or Ikey Mo, as he was called.
“National Anthem, sir,” we said; “we must stand up.” There
was a short pause. Then the tune began again. Again we all
stood up. Mr. Mozley rushed to the window, but there was no
sign of any violinist. For ten minutes there was no interruption,
and then, just when Mr. Mozley, by a shower of punishments,
thought he had got the division in hand once more, the tune
began again, and again we all stood up with plaintive, resigned
faces, as though nobody minded the interruption more than
we did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Another master who was mercilessly ragged was Mr. Bouchier,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
who was deaf, and afterwards a famous <i>Times</i> correspondent
at Sofia—a man who could do what he liked with the Bulgars,
but who could not manage a division of Eton boys. The boys
took mice into his schoolroom, and ultimately he had to go
away.</p>

<p>There were masters who were stimulating teachers and
roused the interest of boys in topics outside the ordinary
routine of work, and others who kept scrupulously to the routine.
The latter were the fairest, for when outside topics were discussed
probably only a minority of the boys listened. It was
above the heads of many. Arthur Benson kept scrupulously
to the routine; he made it as interesting as he could, but rarely
diverged on to stray topics, and never on to such topics that would
only interest a few of the boys. Edward Lyttelton did exactly
the opposite. When I was in his division there were about half a
dozen boys who were advanced, and had got shoved up into his
division by a rapid rise. The others were solid, stolid dunces.
Edward Lyttelton devoted his time to the intelligent, and spent
much time in conversation on such topics as ritual in Church, the
reign of Charlemagne, and the acting at the Comédie française.
He carried on teaching by asking a quantity of questions which
entailed a great deal of interesting comment and argument. In
the meantime the dunces ragged. I was good at answering his
questions, but I joined in the ragging, nevertheless, partly from
a sense of loyalty to raggers in general. The result was that at
the end of the half I was top of his division for the school-time,
but I forfeited the prize owing, as he said in my report, to my
incorrigible babyishness. My tutor thought this unfair, and
gave me a book instead of the prize. Mr. Rawlins, who was
afterwards Lower Master and then Vice-Provost, was a good
teacher, but his chief hobby was grammar, and he talked far
above our heads. I startled him one day. We were construing
an Ode of Horace, where a phrase occurred mentioning the
difficulty of removing her cubs from, I think, a Gætulan lioness.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He said, “There is a parallel to that in French poetry.” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
said, “Yes,” and quoted the lines from <i>Hernani</i> I had known for
so long:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Il vaudrait mieux aller au tigre même</div>
<div class="verse">Arracher ses petits qu’à moi celui que j’aime.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was dumbstruck.</p>

<p>I was two years a lower boy, and reached the lower division
of fifth form by September 1889. Hugo arrived at Eton, and we
shared a room together. We messed together with Dunglass,
who had an order at Little Brown’s of a shilling a day. Every
day on the sideboard of the passage a large plate used to
await us in a brown paper parcel containing eggs and bacon
or sausages or fish. My tutor changed his house, and we
exchanged the convenient house opposite the school-yard for a
house that was once Marindin’s, on the Etonwick road. It
was far to go, and one had to get up early if one wished for
coffee and a bun at Little Brown’s before early school.</p>

<p>Dunglass and I used to read a good many books. Rider
Haggard and Edna Lyall were our favourite authors; Stevenson
got a second or third place; but <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Ben Hur</i>
were approved of, and <i>Monte Cristo</i> got the first prize of all.
After Rider Haggard and Edna Lyall, I had a passion for
Marion Crawford’s books and read every one I could get hold
of. I have still got a list of the books I read in the year 1889,
marked according to merit. It is as follows:</p>

<p>The reason the last two have no comments was probably
because the red ink in which the comments were made had run
out. I remember being particularly thrilled by <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
and so was Dunglass, who read it at the same time.</p>

<p>The 4th of June was an excitement for boys who were just
beginning their Eton career, but older boys were most blasé
about it and preferred short leave. We made great preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for my first 4th of June; grease spots were ironed
out of the tablecloth, everything that looked untidy was
put away; the window-box, which did duty for a garden, was
prepared and decked. I struck out a bold note in my window-box
by having a fountain in it, made by Mr. Duffield of High
Street, according to my instructions. There was a square
tin basin and a fountain in the middle of it, which was fed from
a tank which was hung high up by the side of the window.
The fountain worked successfully, but made a great mess,
and the boys’ maid had no patience with it. When my tutor
came round in the evening, the night before the 4th of June,
he said the room looked like a whited sepulchre. I had visitors
on the 4th of June. Chérie came, and I forget which other
members of the family.</p>

<p>Once every half the Headmaster used to ask Hugo and myself
to breakfast. This we enjoyed; it was an excellent breakfast,
with lots of sausages. The Headmaster used to look at the
<i>Times</i>, comment on the House of Commons, quote Horace,
and ask after John and Cecil. Other masters asked one to
breakfast as well, and I think few things gave the boys so much
pleasure. They used to discuss every detail of the breakfast
with the other boys afterwards, and retail everything the master
had said. I enjoyed my breakfasts with Mr. Impey most;
he used to tell me about books, and we used to discuss Rider
Haggard and Stevenson. I greatly preferred Rider Haggard,
and I had just read <i>King Solomon’s Mines</i>, and had one night
sat up late reading <i>She</i>.</p>

<p>Long leave and short leave were two great excitements.
When I went for short leave I used to go by the earliest possible
train and arrive at my sister Margaret’s house long before
breakfast. When long leave came about, we always went to a
play on Saturday night, and I remember seeing <i>Captain Swift</i>
at the Haymarket, and Coquelin in <i>L’Étourdi</i>. For my long
leave of the summer of 1889, I had been looking forward for
days to going to see Sarah Bernhardt in <i>La Tosca</i>, but when I
came up to London, I found to my horror that Chérie and my
mother had both been told it was too horrible a play to go
and see. My eloquent advocacy overcame Chérie’s scruples.
“Vraiment,” she said, “tu serais un superbe avocat.” And she,
Margaret, and I went off to the Lyceum and thoroughly enjoyed
Sarah’s harrowing and electric performance. While we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
having dinner, before starting, someone who was there said
that two men who had been to see the play had come out in
the middle. Chérie, who by that time had decided we were to
go, said they must have been <i>des poules mouillées</i>.</p>

<p>I think it was in 1890 that Queen Victoria opened the New
Schools at Eton and made a speech. And one summer while
I was at Eton, the German Emperor inspected the Eton Volunteers.
While he was doing this on horseback, a boy called
Cunliffe let off his rifle and the German Emperor’s horse bolted
into the playing fields.</p>

<p>Well-known people used to come and lecture at the literary
society sometimes, but the only famous man I heard while I
was at Eton was Mr. Gladstone, who lectured at the literary
society in March 1891, on Artemis, as revealed in Homer. I
was fortunate enough to get a ticket for this lecture. The boys,
abstruse as the subject was, were spellbound. There was only
one joke in the lecture, and that would have been better away.
It was this: “Some of you may have heard the old story of
the moon being made of green cheese.” Pause for laughter
and a dead silence. “The moon might just as well,” continued
Mr. Gladstone, “be made of green cheese for all the purposes
she serves in Homer.”</p>

<p>At the end of the lecture the Provost returned thanks, and
then Mr. Gladstone leapt to his feet and made an impassioned
speech on classical education. The last sentence of his peroration
was as follows: “But this, Mr. Provost, I venture to say,
and say with confidence, and it is not a fancy of youth nor the
whim of the moment, but the conviction forced upon me even
more by the experience of life than by any reasoning quality,
that if the purposes of education be to fit the human mind for
the efficient performance of the greatest functions, the ancient
culture, and, above all, the Greek culture, is by far the best and
strongest, the most lasting, and the most elastic instrument
that could possibly be applied to it.”</p>

<p>As he said these words his eyes flashed, he opened and raised
his arms, and his body seemed to expand and grow tall. He
seemed like the priest of culture speaking inspired words. His
voice rolled out in a golden torrent, and as he said the words,
“the best and strongest, the most lasting, the most elastic,”
they seemed to come to him with the certainty of happy inspiration
and with the accent of the unpremeditated. With these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
words his voice reached its highest pitch of crescendo, and then,
slightly dying down, melodiously sank into silence.</p>

<p>This little speech showed me what great oratory could be.</p>

<p>At the end of my first year there was a prize called the
Headmaster’s prize for French, for lower boys. I competed
for this. It was always rather difficult to get a French prize
at Eton, as there was usually a French or a Canadian boy who
spoke and knew the language like a native. There was a
special examination paper for this prize. I and a French boy,
whose name I have forgotten, both got 95 marks out of 100.
Then the papers were looked through again, and it was found
that I had translated the French word <i>hôte</i> by <i>host</i>, when it
should have been guest, so the other boy was given the prize,
but my tutor gave me a book as a consolation. The following
year I competed for the Headmaster’s French prize for boys
in fifth form, and that time I won it, much to the delight of
Chérie and of everyone at Membland.</p>

<p>In fifth form we learnt German as an extra. German was
taught by Mr. Ploetz, who knew the language; and by other
masters, who didn’t. During the lessons of the latter, one paid
no attention, and attended to one’s private affairs. Mr. Ploetz
was an excellent, stimulating teacher, but most unpopular with
the other masters. The boys liked him; he was a book collector,
and had a fine library. He taught me a great deal, not of
German, as I paid no attention to the regular work, but I picked
up from him a mass of miscellaneous information. It was the
fashion to rag during his lessons, and I outdid everyone in
ingenious interruption during Mr. Ploetz’ lessons. It was not
that he couldn’t keep order. He was extremely strict and
competent, but one knew, with the fiendish intuition of boys,
that his complaints would not be taken seriously by the other
masters, or by one’s tutor. This was indeed the case. There
were three forms of punishment at Eton. First of all, one
could get a yellow ticket, which meant one had to do a punishment
of some written kind and get the ticket signed by one’s
tutor. We did not much like leaving out the yellow ticket in a
prominent place for my tutor to see when he came round in the
evening. If matters went further, one was reported to the
Headmaster and received a white ticket. The white ticket was
in force for a week. During that week leave was stopped,
and if the slightest complaint was made by anyone, it meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
being complained of to the Headmaster a second time and a
flogging by the Headmaster. I was complained of by Mr.
Ploetz to the Headmaster. As I guessed, the other masters
took this far from seriously. “What have you been doing to
<i>Mr. Ploetz</i>?” said my tutor. What I had been guilty of was
overt rowdyism, combined with prolonged and unbearable
impertinence, which if done to any other master would have
been taken very seriously indeed. “What <i>have</i> you been
doing to Mr. Ploetz?” said another master to me, with a laugh,
when he met me in the street. I received a white ticket, but
I got through the week without further complaints, and I was
never complained of again.</p>

<p>When I was in fifth form, the school library became a
favourite haunt of mine, and Mr. Burcher, the librarian, a special
friend. Mr. Burcher was a little dapper man, who was pained
when we jumped over the tables, a favourite game of mine, or
if we threw the books about. “Is it a joke,” he would ask
plaintively, “or is it an insult?” But in that library, during
my last year at Eton, I made by myself the discovery of English
poetry, and read the works of Shelley in the three little volumes
of the second Moxon edition of 1850, and the poems of Keats in
Lord Houghton’s one-volume edition. On Sundays I used to go,
rich with my new discoveries, to Norman Tower, and compare
notes with Betty Ponsonby, who knew reams of English poetry
by heart, and we would read each last new favourite poem.
There is no joy in the world like this to discover these things
for the first time. The shabby little Keats and Shelley, the
green volumes of Tennyson, the three dark volumes of Matthew
Arnold—what mines of fairy treasure they represented!</p>

<p>I made friends, through one of his pupils, with Arthur Benson.
I had been in his division twice, but I had never known
him well. One of the Coventrys, Willie Coventry, was his
pupil, and he told Arthur Benson that I liked books and poetry,
and had written a novel called <i>Elvira</i>, which was true (only it
had to be destroyed after I had measles), and was going to write
the libretto of an opera of which he, Coventry, was to write the
music. He was not really musical, and did not know a note
of music technically. He also intended, when I first made his
acquaintance, to write a life of Mary Stuart; but this, like the
opera, never got far.</p>

<p>Arthur Benson was most kind and interested, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
arranged that on Sunday afternoons we should meet in his rooms
and read out poetry. Arnold Ward, Mrs. Humphry Ward’s
son, who was in College, joined us. We read out poetry; if
we had written something ourselves, we left it with Arthur
Benson for a week, he told us what he thought about it next
time. I showed him a Fairies’ Chorus from my libretto. He
said: “I don’t like those galloping metres, but I see you have
got a good vocabulary.” My next effort was an Ode on the
Tercentenary of Eton College, in which Fielding was mentioned
as “the great wielder of the painting pen.” “Have you read
Fielding?” asked Arthur Benson. I had not read Fielding.
“I see,” said Arthur Benson, “you take him on trust.”</p>

<p>There was at that time a newspaper edited by two of the
boys, called the <i>Mayfly</i>. I sent them my poem on Eton College,
but they wisely refused it. The <i>Mayfly</i>, edited by Ramsay, was
an amusing paper, but not quite as good as the <i>Parachute</i>,
which had come out the year before, and was edited by Carr
Bosanquet and others. This was a singularly brilliant newspaper.
It only had three numbers, but they were most successful.
There was at the same time an exceedingly serious newspaper
called <i>The Eton Review</i>, edited, I think, by Beauchamp,
which had articles about the Baconian theory, and other rather
heavy topics. During my last summer a newspaper which had
twenty editors, but only one number, came out, called <i>The
Students’ Humour</i>. There was also a book published in 1891,
called <i>Keate’s Lane Papers</i>, in which there is an excellent poem
by J. K. Stephen, which has never been republished, called
“The Song of the Scug.” It begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“There was a little scug</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Who sat upon a rug,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With a dull and empty brain,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">And would show his indecision</div>
<div class="verse indent4">In a twopenny division,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With a friend of the same low strain.</div>
<div class="verse">And would eat a lot of cherries and see a lot of cricket,</div>
<div class="verse">Till his lips and his fingers were as sticky as the wicket,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But at last he came to be a bald old man</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Who talked about as wildly as a bald man can.</div>
<div class="verse indent4">And he said, by Gad;</div>
<div class="verse indent4">When I was a lad,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And the very best dry bob alive,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">I should have made a million,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">But a man in the Pavilion</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Was killed by my first hard drive.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>J. K. Stephen used often to come down to Eton, dressed
always in slippers, a dark blue flannel blazer, and a dirty pink
cap on the back of his head; and thus dressed, and reading a
small book, I saw him serenely and unconsciously walk across
the pitch during the Winchester match.</p>

<p>Arthur Benson stimulated our reading tremendously, and
we were startled and interested by his frank heresies. He
said he did not care for Milton’s <i>Lycidas</i>. He wished Shakespeare
had been a modern and had written novels. He was indifferent
to Shelley. He loathed Byron, but was none the less
impressed, when one Sunday Arnold Ward read out the description
of the battle of Talavera (<i>Childe Harold</i>, <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> xxxviii.),
and he admitted it was moving. He disliked Carlyle, Ruskin,
and Thackeray. On the other hand, he introduced us to
Matthew Arnold, Rossetti, FitzGerald, and many others, and
encouraged us to go on liking anything we did like. By this
time I had read many novels—Thackeray’s <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Pickwick</i>,
a good deal of Scott (I was given the Waverley Novels
for Christmas 1889), George Eliot’s <i>Adam Bede</i>, <i>The Mill on the
Floss</i>, and quantities of poetry. Betty Ponsonby gave me
Swinburne’s <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>, but explained to me that
the denunciations of God in it only applied to the Greek gods,
and she and my Aunt M’aimée both changed the subject when I
suggested reading Swinburne’s <i>Poems and Ballads</i>.</p>

<p>Willie Coventry and I found out that there was a competition
going on at this time in a magazine called <i>Atalanta</i> for who
should write the best essay in 500 words. You were allowed
to choose your own subject. Willie Coventry won it one month
by writing an essay on Dr. Schliemann’s Excavations, a subject
suggested to him by Arthur Benson. The next month I competed,
and chose as my subject a poem by Edgar Allan Poe
called “For Annie,” and I won the prize too.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1890 I went to stay at the Coventrys’
place at Croome Court in Worcestershire, and Willie Coventry
came to Membland later in the same summer. The libretto I
was writing for him never got further than a few lyrics, and his
score never got further than a few bars and a triumphal march,
which I composed, and even played at one of Miss Copeman’s
afternoon parties. I can still play it now, if pressed.</p>

<p>I had a faint hope at one time that I might be able to get
into the Boats. Arthur Benson had taken me out one day down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
stream and advised me to try. I could row well enough on the
stroke side, but not so well on the bow side of the boat. I put
my name down for Novice Eights, in which boys were tried, and
one evening I started out full of hope. Unfortunately I was told
to row bow in the boat. A tall Colleger stood up in the stern of
the boat to coach us. No sooner had we started than there was a
loud call: “Keep time, Bow—keep time, Bow!” and we had not
gone much farther than the Brocas when I caught so violent a
crab that the coach fell into the water, the boat was partially
submerged, and we had to go back, some of us swimming. I was
never allowed to row in company again, and earned the reputation
of being the only person who had ever swamped a Novice Eight.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1890 Hugo and I went up to London for
long leave. My father and mother were staying at my sister
Elizabeth’s house in Grosvenor Place, and there we heard about
the financial crisis in Baring Brothers, which had nearly ended
in a great disaster. When we went back to Membland at
Christmas everything was different. There was no Christmas
party, and the household was going through a process of gradual
dissolution. Chérie was leaving us, the stables were empty, and
the old glory of Membland had gone for ever.</p>

<p>All through the next year I was engrossed with the discoveries
I was making in English literature. In the summer I sent a
poem to <i>Temple Bar</i>, then edited by George Smith, and to my
great surprise it was printed, and I received a cheque for a
guinea. During that same summer I had a little book of poems
privately printed at Eton, called <i>Damozel Blanche</i>, consisting
of ballads and lyrics.</p>

<p>I was now a member of the House Debating Society, in which
we used to have heated discussions on such subjects as whether
sports were brutalising or not, whether conscription was a good
thing, whether General Booth’s scheme was a sound one, and
whether Mary Queen of Scots had been improperly beheaded.</p>

<p>There was another debating society founded before I left
Eton, called <i>Le Cercle des Débats</i>, in which we made speeches in
French, and I remember M. Hua making a passionate speech
in favour of England relinquishing her hold upon Egypt. I
spoke several times at this debating society, and in the report
on the debate as to whether Monte Carlo should be allowed to
exist, it is recorded that: “M. Baring croyait que c’était un
mauvais endroit mais que cela ne devrait pas être supprimé.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The summer of the Eton Tercentenary, 1891, was great fun,
especially the concert, when Hubert Parry’s beautiful setting
to Swinburne’s “Ode” was performed. I sang among the baritones.
My mother came down for the concert, and Hubert
Parry conducted himself. There was an interesting exhibition
in the school hall, and it was there that I made the acquaintance
of Mrs. Cornish. My Aunt M’aimée introduced me to her, and
I soon became a great friend of the Cornish family, and was
invited by them to go out on water-parties down stream to the
Bells of Ousley and Runnymede, and to have supper with them
afterwards. I enjoyed these water-parties as much as anything
at Eton.</p>

<p>In the summer holidays of 1891 I went to stay with Chérie,
who had left us. She lived with her friend, Miss Charlesworth,
in a little house called Waterlooville, near Cosham, in Hants,
and realised the dream of her life, namely, to have a large garden
of her own full of hollyhocks and sunflowers and sweet peas.</p>

<p>In the Michaelmas half of 1891 I competed for the Prince
Consort’s French prize. I had already done so the last year,
but I was then too young to compete with sixth-form boys, who
were much older, and I was not expected to get a place, but
I came out third. This year it was my great ambition to get
the prize. I thought of nothing else. We had to read several
books—Molière’s <i>L’Avare</i>, Alfred de Vigny’s <i>Cinq Mars</i>, Taine’s
<i>Voyage aux Pyrénées</i>, Victor Hugo’s <i>Ruy Blas</i>, and Brachet’s
<i>Grammaire Historique</i>. Besides this, we were examined in unseen
translations from and into French, and we had to write a
French essay. We were examined by a Monsieur Hammonet.
I worked extremely hard for this examination, and had extra
lessons in the evenings from M. Hua. So did the other competitors.
My serious rival was Grand d’Hauteville, who I think
was a French Canadian, and who spoke French fluently. The
examination took five days, and as it went on I became more
and more convinced that I had not done well and could not
possibly win the prize. When it was over, there was a long
interval of agonising suspense before the result was made
known.</p>

<p>One afternoon I received a summons from my Uncle Henry
Ponsonby to go and see him at Windsor. I found him, not at
Norman Tower, but in a room somewhere in the Castle, and he
told me that the Queen had just received the news of the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the Prince Consort’s prize. She was the first to get this
news; the news was that I was first and had got the prize. I
at once sent a telegram to my mother and to Chérie, and walked
back to Eton, drunk with triumph and delight to tell my tutor.</p>

<p>The news was not published for some days, and I told
nobody, I think, except my tutor and Dunglass. But it came
out at last, and was published in the <i>Times</i> and on the board at
Eton. My father and mother came down to see me, and my
father gave me his own watch: a <i>Breguet</i>, the Demidoff <i>Breguet</i>.
It was then settled that I was not to go back to Eton, but to
go to Germany to learn German and prepare for the Diplomatic
Service competitive examination.</p>

<p>Dunglass went on messing with Hugo and myself until I left
Eton. We had three or four fags and they bored us, and we
could never find things for them to do. Dunglass developed
into a fine Eton football player, and got his House Colours and
then his Field Colours. He was a new boy the same half as I
was, and our alliance lasted unbroken through my Eton life.
One half we learnt bird-stuffing together, and when our mess
funds used to run short Dunglass used to say: “I’ve marked off
an uncle,” and one of his many uncles used to come down and
tip us. Our mess was a lively one, and when there was a whole
holiday on Friday, which necessitated Friday’s work being
done on Thursday, an arrangement which used to be called
doing Friday’s business, we used to sing in a loud chorus a song,
the words of which were:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“Why not to morrow?</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Why not to-morrow?</div>
<div class="verse">Why, because to-morrow is to-day!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The greatest excitements of Eton life were, I always thought,
the House football matches for the House Cup. There was the
Eton and Harrow match, of course, but while I was at Eton
these matches were unexciting and Eton never won, and Dunglass
and I agreed that there were few things we enjoyed more
than driving away from Lord’s. Nothing surpassed the excitement
of the House matches. One year, I think it was the
year before I left, we were supposed to have a small chance of
getting beyond first ties, but our House played so well together
that they got into the ante-final. They then drew Cornish’s,
who had a strong side of powerfully built boys. An epic match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
followed. Durnford’s played as if inspired; they got three
rouges to nil, but failed to convert them into goals, and the
game was almost over. Then, in the last five minutes of the
game, Cornish’s scored a rouge, and being far the heavier team
converted it into a goal, and won the match. Never was there
a more exciting match.</p>

<p>During my last year my chief friends in the House, besides
Dunglass, were Leslie Hamilton, who went into the Coldstream
Guards and was killed in the war, and Crum; and outside the
House, Gerald Cornish. He, too, killed in the war.</p>

<p>Arthur Benson was my greatest friend among the masters,
and I used constantly to have tea with him, and have long talks
about books and every other sort of thing. My last half I was
up to Mr. Luxmoore, who was to be a lifelong friend.</p>

<p>The last days of my last half were like a dream. I was
hardly conscious of the reality of things, and I did not yet
fully realise that my Eton life was coming to an end. There
was no more work to do. The battle for the Prince Consort’s
prize had been fought and won. It was, as Eton triumphs go,
a small triumph—small indeed compared with such glories as
surround those who get the Newcastle, stroke the Eight, or play
in the Field, or at Lord’s in the Eleven; but such as it was, it
gave me as much joy and triumph as my being could hold, and
nothing in after life could ever touch the rapture of the moment
when I knew I had got it.</p>

<p>Now there was nothing left to do but to make every moment
seem as long as possible and to say good-bye. Good-bye to the
School Library, my favourite haunt at Eton, the scene of so
much hurried, scrambled work, of such minute consultations
of ecclesiastical authorities for Sunday Questions, or of translations
of Virgil and Horace, and the Greeks; of such long
and serious discussions of future and present plans and literary
topics, schemes and dreams, poems, plays, operas, novels,
romances, with Willie Coventry and Gerald Cornish. Good-bye
to the leather tables where numberless poems had been
copied out on the grey Library foolscap paper, which for some
reason we used to call <i>electric-light</i> paper; tables over which
we had leapt in wild steeplechases, while Burcher protested,
where so many construes had been prepared, and so many
punishments scribbled, and where the great poets of England
had been surreptitiously discovered, and the accents of Milton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and Keats overheard for the first time, and the visions of
Shelley and Coleridge discerned through the dust of the daily
work and above the din of chattering boys. Good-bye to the
playing fields, to South Meadow, the Field, to Upper School,
and to Williams’ inner room, full of prizes and redolent with the
smell of tree-calf and morocco, where I had so often dreamt of
getting prizes and wondered what I should choose if I ever
managed to get the Prince Consort’s prize. Good-bye to the
Brocas, to Upper Hope and Athens and Romney Weir,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Where the lock-stream gushes,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the cygnet feeds,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and to all the reaches of the river. Good-bye to Windsor and
Norman Tower, and to the chimes of the inexorable school
clock; to my little room with its sock cupboard, bureau, and
ottoman, to Little Brown’s and to Phœbe, and then to one’s
friends: to my Dame and to my tutor, and to Arthur Benson,
and the unforgettable readings and talks in his house.</p>

<p>I went to Williams’ to choose my prize, and while I was there
Mr. Cornish strolled in, and seeing what I was doing, he said:
“Of course you will choose a lot of little books—boys always
do—but what you ought to do is to get Littré’s Dictionary or
all Sainte Beuve.” This was asking too much in the way of
sense, and I compromised. I chose a Shakespeare in twelve
volumes, bound in tree calf, a Milton in three volumes, and a few
other small books. My tutor gave me two volumes of Ruskin;
Mr. Luxmoore gave me a volume of Ruskin as well. Arthur
Benson gave me <i>Ionica</i>. Just before leaving I had the honour
of dining with my tutor, which made one feel already as if
one was entering a new world. The hour struck when I was
actually leaving Eton. Up to that last moment all had been
excitement and fun, but when I was actually sitting in the
train and crossing the fifteen arches railway bridge, and Windsor
Castle and the trees of the Brocas came into sight, the whole of
the past, the Eton past, surged up and overwhelmed me like a
flood, and I realised in that last fleeting glimpse of the trees,
the river, and the grey Castle all that Eton life had meant, and
what it was that in leaving Eton I was saying good-bye to.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">GERMANY</span></h2>

<p>I spent the Christmas holidays, after leaving Eton, at
Membland. I had had another little book of poems
printed privately as a Christmas present for my mother,
and I was still making discoveries in English literature, and
of these the most important of all: Shakespeare and Milton’s
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. We travelled up in January to London, and it
was settled that I was to go to Germany to learn German. My
father heard of a family in Hanover where English boys were
taken, but there was no room there. Someone then gave him
the address of a Dr. Timme who lived at Hildesheim, near
Hanover, and also took in Englishmen. It was settled that I
was to go there. I started at the end of the month, and at
Victoria Station I met Hubert Cornish, who was going to Dresden
to learn German. We travelled together to Hanover <i>via</i>
Flushing, and we were both of us seasick, and both swore that
we would never cross the Channel again. We arrived at Hanover
the next evening and stayed at Kasten’s Hotel. The next
morning we went on by the same train. I got out at Hildesheim,
and Hubert Cornish went on to Dresden. Hubert Cornish had
just left Eton, but he was older than I was, and I had only seen
him in the distance, and at his father’s house at picnics. We
made great friends at once. Hildesheim was a charming little
old town. One part of it was really old, and straight out of a
fairy-tale, with houses with high gabled roofs, and mediæval
carvings on them, and there were many quaint and interesting
churches, including the old cathedral with its ravishingly
beautiful cloister behind it, and a rose-tree said to be a thousand
years old. Dr. Timme had a small house in the Weissenburger-Strasse
on the edge of the modern town. It was a two-storied,
square, grey house with a flat roof, looking out on to the street
on one side, and on to a garden at the back. I was received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Frau Doktor Timme. Her husband was a master at the <i>Real
Gymnasium</i>, and he was at school when I arrived. I could not
speak a word of German. It was a curious sensation to live
with a family and partake of their daily life and not to be able
to understand a word they said; to go out for walks and pretend
to be joining in and following a conversation when one had
not the remotest idea of the drift of it. I started lessons at once,
and bought a small Heine, which I used to read to myself, and I
soon understood that. It was bitterly cold. There was still
snow on the ground.</p>

<p>There were three children in the house: a dear little girl
called Aenna, and a little boy called Kurt, and an older boy,
about twelve, called Atho. Dr. Timme had two spinster sisters
who lived in a house not far off with another old lady who was
called <i>Die Alte Tante</i>, and Frau Timme had a brother who was
called Onkel Adolf, and who had fought in the Franco-Prussian
War, and her mother was alive.</p>

<p>I found life interesting in spite of not understanding the
language. In the early morning I used to go downstairs and
have coffee and <i>Apfelgelee</i>. We had <i>Mittagessen</i> at one, and
after that the household indulged in a <i>Mittagschläfchen</i>. At
four in the afternoon we again drank coffee and ate <i>Apfelgelee</i>,
and we had supper at half-past seven, at which there would
generally be some delicacy like <i>Bratkartoffel</i> or <i>Leberwurst</i> or
<i>Häringsalat</i>. Many English boys had been there before;
and Frau Timme told me that we English, as a rule, disliked
German dishes. The first German phrase I remember understanding
was when Frau Timme announced to one of the aunts
a surprising fact about me that I ate everything (“<i>Er isst
alles</i>”). In the evening the aunts and other people used to
visit us, and sometimes we would go to a concert. The Timmes
were great friends with the family of Herr Musik-Direktor
Nick, who was a musician, and all his family played; they had
entrancing musical evenings of trios and duets for violin, pianoforte,
and viola. Herr Musik-Direktor Nick’s nephew, Wunnibald,
gave me lessons on the pianoforte. I had German lessons
with Dr. Timme.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I used to go for long walks with Dr. Timme
and his brother-in-law, and we walked to the Galgenberg, to the
Steinberg, and the Moritzberg, rather bleak hills of fir-trees,
stopping as a rule at a small <i>Wirtshaus</i>, where we used to drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
beer or coffee. In the house there was a small drawing-room
downstairs, where the guest of honour always sat on the sofa.
A smart drawing-room or the <i>Gute Stube</i>, which was only opened
on rare and state occasions. Frau Timme told me one day that
she knew this room was a useless extravagance, but it gave her,
she said, such great pleasure that she could not sacrifice it.
Upstairs, Dr. Timme had a sitting-room, where I took my lessons
with him, and I had a sitting-room where I did my work. After
about a month I could understand what was being said, and in
about two months’ time I could make myself understood and
carry on a conversation. I used sometimes to go to the theatre
at Hanover, coming back by train afterwards. The first time
I saw Schiller’s <i>Wallenstein’s Tod</i> I did not understand a word of
it. One night I went to hear <i>Tannhäuser</i>. Wagner was only
a name to me, and meant something vaguely noisy. I had no
idea he wrote about interesting or romantic subjects. I had no
idea of what <i>Tannhäuser</i> was about. I went expecting a tedious
evening of dry and ultra-classical, unintelligible music. As
soon as the orchestra began the overture, I was overwhelmed. I
did not know that music was capable of so tremendous an effect.
The Venusberg music and the “Pilgrims’ Chorus” opened a new
world, and I was so excited afterwards that I could not sleep a
wink. I was stunned by these magnetic effects of sound.
Curiously enough, I left it at that, and made no further effort to
go and hear any more Wagner. I was almost afraid of repeating
the experience for fear of being disappointed, and the next time
I went to the opera it was to hear Verdi’s <i>Otello</i>.</p>

<p>I happened to mention casually that it was my birthday on
27th April, and when I came down that morning I found in the
drawing-room a beautiful cake or <i>Apfeltorte</i> with eighteen
candles burning on it and a present from every member of the
family. I could talk German quite fluently by this time. Frau
Timme suggested that I should make the acquaintance of some
of the boys at the schools. There were two large schools at
Hildesheim, a Gymnasium, and a Real Gymnasium. The Real
Gymnasium concentrated on the modern. The Gymnasium
was more classical in its programme. For the purpose of getting
to know the boys I was introduced to a grown-up boy called
Braun, who was, I think, a native of Hildesheim. Most of the
boys at both schools came from different parts of Germany and
lived <i>en pension</i> in different families. The boys from both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
schools used to meet in the evening before supper at a restaurant
called Hasse, where a special room was kept for them. Braun
was an earnest and extremely well-educated youth, a student of
geology. Before I was taken to Hasse, he said I must be
instructed in the rules of the <i>Bierkomment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that is to say, the
rules for drinking beer in company, which were, as I found out
afterwards, the basis of the social system. These rules were
intricate, and when Braun explained them to me, which he did
with the utmost thoroughness, the explanation taking nearly
two hours, I did not know what it was all about. I did not
know it had anything to do with drinking beer. I afterwards
learned, by the evidence of my senses and by experience, the
numerous and various points of this complicated ritual, but the
first evening I was introduced to Hasse I was bewildered by
finding a crowd of grown-up boys seated at a table; each one
introduced himself to me by standing to attention and saying
his name (“<i>Mein Name ist So-and-so</i>”). After which they sat
down and seemed to be engaged in a game of cross-purposes.</p>

<p>The main principles which underlay this form of social
intercourse were these. You first of all ordered a half-litre
of beer, stating whether you wanted light or dark beer (<i>dunkles</i>
or <i>helles</i>). It was given to you in a glass mug with a metal top.
This mug had to remain closed whatever happened, otherwise
the others put this mug on yours, and you had to pay for every
mug which was piled on your own. Having received your
beer, you must not drink it quietly by yourself, when you were
thirsty; but every single draught had to be taken with a
purpose, and directed towards someone else, and accompanied
by a formula. The formula was an opening, and called for
the correct answer, which was either final and ended the matter,
or which was of a kind to provoke a counter-move, in the form
of a further formula, which, in its turn, necessitated a final
answer. You were, in fact, engaged in toasting each other
according to system. When you had a fresh mug, with foam
on the top of it, that was called <i>die Blume</i>, and you had to
choose someone who was in the same situation; someone who
had a <i>Blume</i>. You then said his name, not his real name but
his beer name, which was generally a monosyllable like <i>Pfiff</i>
(my beer name was Hash, pronounced Hush), and you said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to him: “<i>Prosit Blume</i>.” His answer to this was: “<i>Prosit</i>,”
and you both drank. To pretend to drink and not drink was
an infringement of the rules. If he had no beer at the time
he would say so (“<i>Ich habe keinen Stoff</i>”), but would be careful
to return you your <i>Blume</i> as soon as he received it, saying:
“<i>Ich komme die Blume nach</i>” (“I drink back to you your
<i>Blume</i>”). Then, perhaps, having disposed of the <i>Blume</i>, you
singled out someone else, or someone perhaps singled you out,
and said: “<i>Ich komme Ihnen Etwas</i>” (“I drink something to
you”). When you got to know someone well, he suggested
that you should drink <i>Bruderschaft</i> with him. This you did
by entwining your arm under his arm, draining a whole glass,
and then saying: “<i>Prosit Bruder</i>.” After that you called each
other “<i>Du</i>.” Very well. After having said “<i>Ich komme Ihnen</i>”
or “<i>Ich komme Dir etwas</i>,” he, in the space of three beer minutes,
which were equivalent to four ordinary minutes, was obliged
to answer. He might either say: “<i>Ich komme Dir nach</i>” or
“<i>Ich komme nach</i>” (“I drink back”). That settled that
proceeding. Or he might prolong the interchange of toasts by
saying: “<i>Uebers Kreuz</i>,” in which case you had to wait a little
and say: “<i>Unters Kreuz</i>,” and every time the one said this,
the other in drinking had to say: “<i>Prosit</i>.” Then the person
who had said “<i>Uebers Kreuz</i>” had the last word, and had
to say: “<i>Ich komme definitiv nach</i>” (“I drink back to you
finally”), and that ended the matter. If you had very little
beer left in your mug you chose someone else who was in the
same predicament, and said: “<i>Prosit Rest</i>.” It was uncivil if you
had a <i>rest</i> to choose someone who had plenty of beer left. If
you wanted to honour someone or to pay him a compliment, you
said “<i>Speziell</i>” after your toast, which meant the other person
was not obliged to drink back. You could also say: “<i>Ich komme
Dir einen halben</i>” (“I drink you a half glass”), or even “<i>einen
Ganzen</i>” (“a whole glass”). The other person could then double
you by saying: “<i>Prosit doppelt</i>.” In which case he drank back a
whole glass to you and you then drank back a whole glass to him.</p>

<p>Any infringement of these rules, or any levity in the
manner the ritual was performed, was punished by your being
told to “<i>Einsteigen</i>”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (or by the words, “<i>In die Kanne</i>”),
which meant you had to go on drinking till the offended party
said “<i>Geschenkt</i>.” If you disobeyed this rule or did anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
else equally grave, you were declared by whoever was in
authority to be in B.V., which meant in a state of <i>Beer ostracism</i>.
Nobody might then drink to you or talk to you. To emerge
from this state of exile, you had to stand up, and someone
else stood up and declared that “<i>Der in einfacher B.V. sich
befindender</i>” (“The in-simple-beer-banishment-finding-himself
so-and-so”) will now drink himself back into <i>Bierehrlichkeit</i>
(beer-honourability) once again. He does it. At the words,
“<i>Er thut es</i>,” you set a glass to your lips and drank it all.
The other man then said: “<i>So-and-so ist wieder bierehrlich</i>”
(“So-and-so is once more beer honourable”). Any dispute on a
point of ritual was settled by what was called a <i>Bierjunge</i>. An
umpire was appointed, and three glasses of beer were brought.
The umpire saw that the quantity in each of the glasses was
exactly equal, pouring a little beer perhaps from one or the
other into his own glass. A word was then chosen, for choice a
long and difficult word. The umpire then said: “<i>Stosst an</i>,” and
on these words the rivals clinked glasses; he then said: “<i>Setzt an</i>,”
and they set the glasses to their lips. He then said: “<i>Loss</i>,”
and the rivals drained the glasses as fast as they could, and the
man who finished first said: “<i>Bierjunge</i>,” or whatever word
had been chosen. The umpire then declared the winner. All
these proceedings, as can be imagined, would be a little difficult
to understand if one didn’t know that they involved drinking
beer. Such had been my plight when the ritual was explained
to me by Mr. Braun. I found the first evening extremely
bewildering, but I soon became an expert in the ritual, and
took much pleasure in raising difficult points.</p>

<p>These gatherings used to happen every evening. If you
wished to celebrate a special occasion you ordered what was
called a <i>Tunnemann</i>, which was a huge glass as big as a small
barrel which was circulated round the table, everyone drinking
in turn as out of a loving-cup. A record was kept of these
ceremonies in a book. The boys who attended these gatherings
were mostly eighteen or nineteen years old, and belonged to the
first two classes of the school, the <i>Prima</i> and the <i>Secunda</i>.
They belonged to a <i>Turnverein</i>, a gymnastic association, and
were divided into two classes—the juniors who were called
<i>Füchse</i> and the seniors who were not. The <i>Füchse</i> had to
obey the others.</p>

<p>Another thing which I found more difficult than the <i>Bierkomment</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was a card game which Dr. Timme tried to teach me.
It was the game of Skat, and was played by three people, one
against two, with a possible fourth person cutting in, but only
by three at a time. When Dr. Timme first explained it to me I
understood German imperfectly, and I could not make head
or tail of the game. This disgusted Dr. Timme, who said:
“<i>Herr Baring hat kein Interesse dafür</i>.” But at the end of
five years, after repeated visits to Germany, and with the help
of an English book on the subject, I ended by mastering the
principles of the game. I think it is the best game of cards
ever invented, and by far the most difficult. I will not attempt
to explain it, but it is a mixture of “Solo-whist,” “Préférence,”
and “Misery,” with a dash of “Picquet” in it. Everybody
plays for his own hand and you have no partner; so you
are responsible to yourself alone. I did not learn the game
until several years later.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hubert Cornish had left Dresden and was
established at Professor Ihne’s at the Villa Felseck, Heidelberg.
Professor Ihne, who knew my cousins, invited me to go there. I
set out, and after travelling all day I arrived at one in the morning
and found not only Hubert but an American called Mr. Hazlitt
Alva Cuppy, who was studying German, and who had come
to the station in case I should want help with my luggage. The
next morning I woke up and went to the window, and beheld one
of the most beautiful sights it is possible to see: Heidelberg
Castle and the hills of the Neckar in spring. It was the beginning
of May. It was fine and hot; the trees had just put on their
most brilliant green; the lilac and laburnum were out. The
fields, yellow with buttercups and scarlet with poppies, were
like impressionist pictures of the newest school. After the slow
spring and the bleak fir-tree-clad country of the north it was
like coming suddenly into another world. At breakfast I was
introduced to Professor Ihne, a large, comfortable Professor
with white hair and spectacles. I had met him once before at
the Norman Tower. The two other inmates of the house besides
Hubert were Mr. Hazlitt Alva Cuppy and Mr. Otto Kuhn, an
Austrian; both of them were attending the lectures of the
University. The Villa Felseck was half-way up a hill covered
with vines, and Professor Ihne made his own wine. In the
garden there was a pergola under which we worked outdoors
at a table. Then a most blissful epoch began. In the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
we went to lectures in the University and strolled about the
town, and in the afternoons we went for walks in the woods or
for expeditions on the river.</p>

<p>Heidelberg was full of students, and our ambition was to get
to know some of them, but we did not know how to set about
doing this. We were too shy to take any steps, and every day
we settled we would take a step, but the day passed, and nothing
had been done. We confided our hesitations to a lady—a kind,
motherly lady who kept a <i>Wirtshaus</i>, and she said that the
matter was simple. What she did I do not know, but that
very day we received a visit from the representatives of a
<i>Burschenschaft</i> called the <i>Franconia</i>, who asked us to visit their
clubhouse with a view to our being received as guests. We
went there the next morning, and the conditions under which
we could be either <i>Konkneipante</i> or <i>Kneipgäste</i> of the Germania
were read out to us.</p>

<p>A <i>Konkneipant</i> was a kind of unofficial member, a <i>Kneipgas</i>
was simply a guest with certain obligations. The former,
the <i>Konkneipant</i>, seemed to be liable to many alarming
possibilities and conditions, and he had to be prepared to
fight duels, even if he did not do so, so we chose the latter
status, and were enrolled as <i>Kneipgäste</i>.</p>

<p>We attended a <i>Kneipe</i> that night, I think. All the rules
of the <i>Bierkomment</i>, which I have already described, obtained.
You sat at a table, and endless mugs of beer were brought
in, and toasts were drunk, according to ritual, but the
evening was enlivened by the singing of songs in chorus. Someone
accompanied the songs, everyone had a song-book, and the
entertainment led off with Goethe’s song, “Ergo Bibamus”;
after that a song was sung about every quarter of an hour:
“Der Mai ist gekommen,” “Es hatten drei Gesellen ein fein
Collegium,” or “Es zogen drei Burschen wohl über den
Rhein.”</p>

<p>The entertainment went on till about one in the morning.
There was an official <i>Kneipe</i> three nights a week (<i>offiziell</i>), and
an unofficial <i>Kneipe</i> (<i>offizieuse</i>) on the other nights. Besides
this, the members of the <i>Burschenschaft</i> met in the morning for
<i>Frühschoppen</i> in the castle gardens, or elsewhere, and in the
afternoon went expeditions together. In the morning they had
fencing lessons. They never went to lectures. When they
wanted to work they went for a term to another university,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and did nothing but work there. One morning Hubert and I
attended a lecture on <i>Philosophie</i>, that is to say, history, and
curiously enough the lecture was about England. The lecturer
went through the gifts which different nations had bequeathed
to the world as a legacy; how Greece had given the arts to the
world, and the Romans had given it law; England’s gift to the
world, he said, was <i>Freedom</i>, and as he said the word <i>Freiheit</i>,
his voice rang, and we felt all of a tremble.</p>

<p>The country round Heidelberg was at this time of year at its
most glorious. The fields were sheets of the brightest yellow.
At night choruses of nightingales sang; the air was heavy with
the smell of the lilacs. Sometimes we would go up the river
and to the little town of Neckarsteinar, which is like a toy city
on the top of a green hill, with a wall round it, and is exactly
what I imagined the “green hill far away” to be when I was a
child, except that it had a wall. One evening—but this was
later in the summer when I went back a second time to
Heidelberg—we had a <i>Kneipe</i> in Dr. Ihne’s garden and invited
the Germania <i>Burschenschaft</i>. Professor Ihne came and made a
speech and then left us; songs were sung, and I made a speech
in German, and we sang: “Alt Heidelberg du Feine.”</p>

<p>Besides all these events, Hubert and I spent a good deal of
time reading and discussing theories of life. We were intoxicated
by Swinburne, spellbound by Kipling, and great devotees of
Meredith and Hardy. We also read a certain amount of German,
and I remember reading Lewes’ <i>Life of Goethe</i>. I had already
read a certain amount of Goethe and Schiller with Dr. Timme,
including <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>, <i>Iphegenie auf Tauris</i>, and
<i>Tasso</i>. <i>Faust</i> and the lyrics I had read by myself as soon as I
could spell out the letters. Professor Ihne used to discuss books
with us. He admired Byron enormously. He had no patience
with the German infatuation for Tennyson, especially for
“Enoch Arden,” which he thought a childish poem. Byron,
he used to say, was a giant; Tennyson a dwarf. Shelley, he
admitted, had written a fine philosophical poem: “Prometheus
Unbound,” and Swinburne could <i>schöne Versen machen</i>. He
could not abide the German cult for Shakespeare. It was not
that he did not admire Shakespeare as a dramatist and a poet,
but the German searching for meanings in the plays, and the
philosophical theories deduced from them and spun round his
work, made him impatient. This was a sound point of view, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
he approached Shakespeare in much the same spirit as Dryden
and Dr. Johnson did. Hamlet annoyed him. Why, he used
to ask, did Hamlet presume to think he was born to set the
world aright? Nobody had asked him to do so. Othello, he
said, was stupid: <i>ein dummer Kerl</i>. The tragedies hurt him
too much. He preferred Schiller.</p>

<p>He had no great love for Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i> either;
he thought there was a lot of tautology in the English language.
He said the phrase, “Assemble and meet together,” in the
Prayer Book was an instance of this. He said the modern
English writers used unnecessarily long Latin words. He had
actually seen the word to <i>pullulate</i> in a <i>Times</i> leading article.
Swarm would have meant the same thing and been a thousand
times better. He was broad-minded in politics and the contrary
of a Chauvinist. He had a hearty dislike of Bismarck. There
was something refreshingly Johnsonian about him, and when
Mr. Cuppy read him the thesis which he destined to show up
to the Heidelberg examiners for his degree, Professor Ihne
repeated the first sentence, which ran thus: “Ever since my
earliest years I determined to be a great man,” and said:
“Pooh, pooh, you can’t say that <i>here</i>.” “But it’s true,” said
Mr. Cuppy.</p>

<p>Mr. Cuppy was a charming character. He had been in about
twenty-five professions before arriving at Heidelberg, and he
had been in a circus troop, a stoker in the railway, a clerk, a
journalist, a farmer, and I don’t know how many other things,
and he was now working hard for his degree. He was the
kindest man I have ever met, and there was no trouble he would
not take to do one a service, and there was no atom of selfishness
in his composition.</p>

<p>The students took us to the <i>Mensur</i> to see the duels. The
students fought with sharp rapiers, as sharp as a razor on
one side, which they held high over their heads, all the fighting
being done by the strength of the wrist; you could only, from
the position that the rapier was held in, wound your adversary
on the top of his head or on the side of his cheek, but lest your
rapier should go astray, and wound some other vital part the
duellists wore a padded jacket, and a protection for the neck.
The wounds on the top of the head were formidable, and
directly after a fight they were sewn up. The <i>Mensur</i> reeked
with iodoform. After the entertainment was over <i>Maibowle</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
drunk, a delicious sort of cup in which wild strawberries floated.
Hubert used to have fencing lessons and found the exercise
difficult.</p>

<p>The time came when I had to go back to Hildesheim.
Shortly after I arrived there the Timmes invited Hubert Cornish
to come and stay with them, and he stayed with us for about ten
days. During his visit we went for a short walking tour in the
Harz Mountains and climbed up the Brocken, a disappointing
mountain, as, so far from meeting Mephistopheles and the
witches, you walk up a broad and intensely civilised and tidy
road, with a plentiful array of notice-boards, till you get to the
top, where it is uncomfortably cold. After he left us, it was
settled, at my earnest request, that I should go to the school, the
Real Gymnasium, and take part in some of the lessons. I was
to be an <i>Oberprimaner</i>: in the first class, that is to say; and to
attend not all the lessons, but the English, German, and History
classes. Before entering upon this school career, Frau Doktor
Timme told me that I must make an official visit to all the
masters with gloves. So I bought a pair of shiny <i>glacé</i> gloves
and paid an official visit to the Headmaster and the various
undermasters. The first class I attended was a mathematical
lesson, given by the Headmaster. I sat next to a boy called
Schwerin, whom I met years later as the director of one of the
Berlin theatres. I was not meant to go to this lesson, and I
went there by accident, but the Headmaster told me I might
stay and listen to it if I liked. It was so far above my head
that I did not even know what it was about. At the English
lesson I was more at home, and I was asked to give the English
dictation. I did this, but the boys at once complained, as I did
not read out the English with the German pronunciation, which
they were accustomed to, and they could not understand me.
The master said they were quite right, and that it was plain I
did not know how to pronounce English. The lessons in German
literature and in history were interesting. Every week the
boys had to write a German essay on the topic that was being
discussed, or rather on the book that was being read and
diagnosed. This essay was the main feature of the week’s work,
just as Latin verses were at Eton. The writing of this essay
took an enormous amount of time and trouble. I only wrote
one, on Schiller’s <i>Braut von Messina</i>. It had to be neatly
copied out, on paper folded in a special way, and the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
had to be divided into sections. The history master was fond
of drawing parallels between ancient and modern history, and
when he discussed the Punic wars, he laid stress on the fact
that sea power had been beaten by land power. That was,
he said, the universal lesson of history, and let England lay
this matter to heart. The Napoleonic Wars seemed to have
escaped him.</p>

<p>After I had been at Hildesheim a little time, Frau Timme
told me one day that perhaps I was unaware how greatly
Englishmen were disliked in Germany. This was a complete
surprise to me, as I had always thought the relations between
the two countries were supposed to be good, and that in a kind of
way the Germans were supposed to be our cousins. “No,” said
Frau Timme; “there is a real prejudice against English people,”
and Timme added: “There had always been <i>ein gewisser Neid</i>,”
a certain envy of the English. They knew, they said, that
individual Englishmen were often admirable, but politically
and collectively the English were disliked. One grievance
was we supplied, they said, the French with coal during
the Franco-Prussian War: another, the behaviour of the
Empress Frederick, who was accused of redecorating
Frederick the Great’s rooms at Potsdam. I found afterwards
the Empress Frederick’s doings were a universal
topic, wherever I went in Germany. Frau Timme’s brother,
Onkel Adolph, deplored the relations between Great Britain
and Germany, which he said could not well be worse,
although looking back on that time they were supposed then,
I think, to be good. The Timmes were Hanoverians, and
used still to reckon in <i>Thalers</i> and speak of the Prussians with
dislike; in spite of this they were whole-hearted admirers of
Bismarck. I enjoyed my little bit of school life at Hildesheim
immensely. I used to get up at half-past six, walk to school
and be there by seven, wear a red cap, take part in the few
classes I attended, and then come back for luncheon. In the
afternoon, I used to go for walks or bathe in the little river
which ran through Hildesheim, called the Innerste. In the
evenings before supper we met at Hasse’s, and sometimes we
used to walk to a distant village and hold a <i>Kneipe</i>, after
which the boys used to dance to the strains of <i>Donauwellen</i>.
It was difficult to believe that one had ever lived any other
kind of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Domestic life in the Timme family was full of infinite charm
and many amusing little incidents. Dr. Timme grew a melon,
which he kept in a cucumber frame. It was not a satisfactory
melon, for it never grew to be larger than a tennis ball.
It was hard and green. Nevertheless, one day Dr. Timme made
the announcement that the melon would be ready for eating
in a fortnight’s time. “<i>In vierzehn Tagen wird die Melone
gegessen</i>,” were his actual words. Frau Doktor looked sceptical.
When the fortnight had elapsed Timme brought in the melon,
which was still no bigger and no softer, and said, “<i>Heute essen
wir die Melone</i>” (“To-day the melon will be eaten”), and he
cut it with difficulty into twelve bits. Frau Doktor said it was
unripe, and not fit to be eaten, and that it was quite hard and
green. “No,” said Timme, “<i>Dass ist die Sorte, sie bleibt immer
grün</i>” (“It is that kind of melon: an evergreen”). He added
later, “<i>Man sollte immer unreifes Obst essen. Die Thiere suchen
sich immer unreifes Obst aus</i>” (“One ought always to eat unripe
fruit. Animals eat unripe fruit for choice”).</p>

<p>I used often to visit the two aunts, Dr. Timme’s sisters.
They had a charming little house and a conservatory. Little
Aenchen said one day that many people in the summer went
to Switzerland or to Italy, but <i>die Tante</i> did no such thing—she
merely moved into the conservatory. (<i>Sie zieht nur in die
Blumenstube.</i>) One of the aunts had a passion for the opera,
and knew the plot of every opera ever written, and kept the
programmes, and was a mine of information on the subject. I
once said something rather disparaging about Switzerland to
her, and she could not get over this, and for ever afterwards she
would say that whenever she looked at her album of Swiss
photographs she used to say: “<i>Gott! nein! dass Herr Baring das
nicht mag!</i>” (“To think of Mr. Baring not liking that!”)</p>

<p>Sometimes she would invite us to tea, and we would have an
<i>Apfeltorte</i> in the garden, and if it was fine the “<i>Alte Tante</i>”
used to come down. Kurt’s future used to be discussed, and the
army was mentioned as a possible career. “No,” cried the
<i>Alte Tante</i>; “an officer’s life is a brilliant misery” (“<i>Ein
glänzendes Elend</i>”). I said that in other professions you had
the <i>Elend</i> without the <i>Glanz</i>, the misery without the brilliance,
and she was delighted with this <i>mot</i>.</p>

<p>My father, who finished his education in Germany, at
Gotha (after having gone to school at Bath at the age of six in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
stage-coach), used always to say that there was nothing in the
world for simplicity and charm to compare with the life in a
small unpretentious household in the Germany of old days.
He used to tell a story of some Coburg royal lady whom he met
at Gotha saying to him after Queen Victoria’s marriage to
Prince Albert, “<i>Wenn Sie nach England kommen, suchen Sie
meinen Vetter Albrecht aus and grüssen Sie ihn von mir</i>” (“When
you go back to England, look up my Cousin Albert and give
him my love”).</p>

<p>The simplicity and the charm he described were to be found
in the Timme household at Hildesheim. In the cosy winter
evenings, in the little drawing-room with its warm stove, when
the lamp used to be put on the table opposite the place of honour,
the sofa, against the wall at the end of the room, a bottle
of beer and glasses would be brought, and Dr. Timme would
light his cigar and suggest a game of Skat, and Onkel Adolph
would stroll behind my chair and say: “<i>Nein, Herr Baring, das
dürfen Sie nicht spielen.</i>” Then perhaps Frau Timme’s mother
would look in and occupy the place of honour, and perhaps
Tante Agnes (who was an unappreciated poetess) or Tante
Emile (the opera lover), and perhaps a neighbour, Fräulein
Schultzen, who received English girls in her house, or Frau
Ober-Förster. Then Frau Doktor’s mother would take out
her knitting and the children would be discussed. “<i>Nächsten
Monat</i>,” someone would say: “<i>Bekomme Ich neue Mädchen.</i>”
Onkel Adolph and Dr. Timme would talk mild politics, and
faintly deprecate the present state of things; perhaps Herr
Wunibald Nick would be there and sing a song—“<i>Es liegt eine
Krone im tiefen Rhein</i>”—and deplore the amount of operas
by well-known composers which were never performed. “<i>Wird
nicht gegeben</i>,” he would exclaim, after every item of his long
list, or would almost weep from enthusiasm for the second
act of <i>Tristan</i>, although no Wagnerite he. While this talk went
on in the major key, in a subdued minor the aunts and Frau
Doktor and Frau Ober-Förster would tell the latest developments
of a neighbour’s illness, and the climax of the tale would
be reached by someone saying: “<i>Dann liess sie den Arzt rufen</i>”
(“Then she sent for the doctor”). There would be a pause,
and someone else would inevitably ask, “<i>Welchen Arzt?</i>”
(“Which doctor?”), as there were many doctors in Hildesheim,
and opinions were sharply divided on their merits. The answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
would perhaps be: “Brandes,” and then there would be a sigh
of relief from some, a resigned shrug from others, as if to say:
“Poor things, they knew no better.”</p>

<p>And the conversation would be <i>vernünftig</i>, and the old
people would say that the big towns were spoiling everything,
that life was a hustle and a rush, that Fräulein So-and-so was
<i>ein unverschämtes Wesen</i>, and would bewail, as in Heine’s lovely
poem, that everything had been better in their time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Wie Lieb’ und Treu’ und Glauben</div>
<div class="verse">Verschwunden aus der Welt,</div>
<div class="verse">Und wie so teuer der Kaffee,</div>
<div class="verse">Und wie so rar das Geld!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And over all this scene, and through this talk, there would hang
an indefinable wrapping of cosiness and warmth and <i>Gemüthlichkeit</i>,
and one had the same sense of utter simplicity and
intimate comfort that a fairy-tale of Grimm gives one. I
wonder whether the charm and the simplicity have disappeared
from Germany, and whether, in spite of Imperialism, the war,
frightfulness, or anything else, the same thing goes on in the
same way, in hundreds of houses and families!</p>

<p>In any case, whether it exists now or not, it existed then;
and I was privileged to experience it, to enjoy it to the full, and
to look back on it now, after so many years and when so much
that is irreparable has come between it and me, with undying
affection and gratitude, and with an infinitely sad regret.</p>

<p>Once during the war, I had luncheon with one of the R.F.C.
Squadron Messes, where I met a pilot who had learnt German
at the Timmes’. We talked of them, of Atho and of Kurt,
whom he had known grown-up, and at the end of luncheon
that pilot, who was just off to fight the Germans in the air, and
who was so soon to meet with death in the air fighting the
Germans, said to me: “<i>Prosit Timmes.</i>”</p>

<p>In the summer, we would have tea in a little arbour in the
garden, and in the mornings, both in winter and in the summer,
towards eleven o’clock, when I was hungry, I would go and tell
Frau Doktor, and she would take me to the kitchen and fry me
herself some <i>Spiegeleier</i> and <i>Speck</i>. Towards the beginning
of my first summer at Hildesheim a new lodger arrived in the
shape of a German boy called Hans Wippern, the son of a
neighbouring landowner, who had a large farm just outside
Hildesheim. Hans was at the school and was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hungry. One day he had a slight bilious attack and didn’t
come down to <i>Mittagessen</i>, although he was much better.
Frau Doktor said she thought Hans might fancy a pigeon.
“<i>Nein</i>,” said Timme, “<i>Er soll hungern</i>” (“He must fast”).
But Frau Doktor surreptitiously sent up three pigeons to his
bedroom. The food was delicious at the Timmes’, and the great
days were when we had <i>Kartoffeln-puffer</i> for <i>Mittagessen</i>, a sort
of pancake made of potatoes, or as a great treat “<i>Gänzebraten</i>.”
I used to go to the market in the lovely old <i>Markt-platz</i> with
Frau Doktor on the days when she would buy a goose, and on
the way back we would stop at Frau Brandes’ confectionery
and have a slice of <i>Apfeltorte</i>. Frau Brandes was a warm,
welcoming saleswoman, and her confectionery was perfect.</p>

<p>When the long holidays began it was settled that I would
do best to go on a <i>Rundreise</i> and see what I could of Germany.
Dr. Timme arranged my itinerary and I took a <i>Rundreise Billet</i>.
I was to go to Frankfort, Nuremberg, Dresden, Leipzig, and
perhaps Berlin, and so home again. I went back to Heidelberg
first and found Hubert Cornish had become an expert
fencer. We attended many a <i>Kneipe</i> and saw a lot of the
students, and once more I stayed with Professor Ihne.</p>

<p>My recollections of this second visit to Heidelberg are
merged with those of my first visit, and I cannot distinguish
between the two. Hubert Cornish had to go home, and we
settled to go to Cologne by steamer down the Rhine. We went
past Bingen and Coblenz and Bonn and the rocks of the Lorelei,
and we stayed a night at Cologne. There Hubert left me and
went home, and I went back by train to Frankfort. Hubert
had fired me with the desire to hear Wagner. He had heard
many operas at Dresden. The result of his talk was that I
decided to go to Bayreuth. We went one night to Mannheim
to the opera, but I cannot recollect what we saw. At Frankfort
I heard the <i>Mikado</i>, and the <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>, which I
had already heard at Hanover. From Frankfort I went to
Nuremberg, and from Nuremberg to Bayreuth. I had tickets
for one series of performances of the Bayreuth Festival, but
when I arrived I found that there was a performance of the
<i>Meistersinger</i> that very day, and I got a ticket for it at the
station. I took lodgings in a little room in the town. I went
off to the theatre, and the first notes of the orchestra enlarged
one’s conception of what an orchestra could be. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
wonderful experience to hear these operas for the first time,
at the age of eighteen before hearing any discussions about
them, before knowing what they were about, when every
note of the music and every scene of the drama were a
revelation and a surprise. I heard the <i>Meistersinger</i>, <i>Parsifal</i>,
<i>Tristan und Isolda</i>, and <i>Tannhäuser</i>. After the <i>Meistersinger</i>
and <i>Tristan</i>, <i>Tannhäuser</i> seemed tawdry and thin.
These operas were all of them magnificently performed that
year. Scheidemantel, Malten, Materna, and other stars from
Vienna and Dresden were taking part in the Festival, but
even then I thought the scenery ugly, especially the garden
scene in <i>Parsifal</i>, which was made of crude vermilion and
yellow tulips; in the other operas, <i>Tristan</i> and the <i>Meistersinger</i>,
the scenery was sober and adequate, and the lighting
effects were wonderfully well managed, but all that was lost
sight of in the orchestra conducted by Mottl. I do not suppose
there has ever been any finer orchestra playing in the world
than that which I heard when <i>Tristan</i> was performed that year.
It seemed a pity the curtain ever went up, for Tristan, although
he sang well, was an old man (Heinrich Vogt), and Isolda (Rose
Sucher) was a little too massive. At Bayreuth, during the first
series I attended, there were some people I knew, and during
that series and the others I made friends with many other people
whom I had never seen before. One day, during the entr’acte,
the crowd automatically divided as two people passed by—a
lady and her husband—and a space was made round them.
The lady had a small, flowerlike head, and the dividing crowd
near her looked, as she passed, more commonplace and commoner
than it did already. On one of the off-days I saw the same
lady again sitting at a table in a restaurant garden and reading
aloud out of a Tauchnitz novel. At my table there were a
Frenchman and his wife. “Dieu qu’elle est belle,” said the Frenchman,
staring. “Je ne dis pas qu’elle ne soit pas jolie,” said the
French lady, rather nettled. My best friend at Bayreuth was
one of the second violins in the orchestra. He thought the
operas were far too long, especially the second act of <i>Tristan and
Isolda</i>, which he said was for the players more than flesh and
blood could bear. He said it would be no offence to Wagner
to cut it, and after the performance he used to come out from
the theatre terribly exhausted. We often had dinner together,
and he told me a great deal about musical life in Germany. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
also made friends with an English musician who lived at Sydenham,
and we spent the off-days in the country together. I
think I must have stayed for three series of performances, and
I heard each of these operas three times. I went after this to
Dresden, where I enjoyed the picture gallery, and so back to
Hildesheim. In September I received a letter from Professor
Ihne asking me to go back there. The Duke of York was with
him, learning German, so I went once more to Heidelberg and
stayed there over a fortnight. I went back to Hildesheim, and
I had not been there long when I got a telegram telling me
to come home at once. I knew my mother was ill, but a
letter giving me details just missed me, as it went to Heidelberg.
I found my brother-in-law, Bobby Spencer, in London.
He took a special to Bristol, as we had missed the ordinary
night train, and we got to Membland next morning. Never
had Membland looked more beautiful. The days were cloudless
and breathless; the foliage was intact but turned to gold, and
bathed in the quiet October sunshine. I arrived just in time.
A specialist came down from London, but there was nothing to
be done. Chérie came down from Hampshire, and D., who had
married Mr. Crosbie, came back and stayed in the house, but it
was only for a few days.</p>

<p>I went to London and stayed a day or two in Charles Street
with my brother John. I spent a night at King’s College,
Cambridge, and then I went to Hildesheim on my way to
Berlin, where it was settled I was to go.</p>

<p>I was only a day or two at Hildesheim. Nothing could have
been kinder than the Timmes were to me then, and Onkel
Adolph, when he heard I had lost my coat, said: “<i>Wenn alle
Menschen so harmlos wie Sie wären, Herr Baring, so würde die
Welt ein reines Paradies sein, aber! aber!</i>”</p>

<p>In Berlin I stayed at first at an hotel, and then I took two
rooms on the top floor of a house in the Unter den Linden.
I knew no one in the town at first, but a few days after I was
settled in my rooms I met my cousin, Arthur Ponsonby, who
was learning German there too, and who was staying at a pension
in the Potsdamer Strasse. Although I had seen him all my
life I had not known him before, and we gradually made
each other’s acquaintance. As we were both fond of the
theatre we went to plays together and saw a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
interesting things. Ibsen’s <i>Doll’s House</i>, which was admirably
played at the Berliner Theater, and Sudermann’s <i>Die Ehre</i>,
some Shakespeare performances, in which Ludwig Barnay
played, and many plays translated from the French. At the
Residenz Theater there was an excellent comic actor called
Alexander. One night we went to see <i>Faust</i>, Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>,
not Gounod’s, performed at the <i>Schauspielhaus</i>, and when the
opening speech, “<i>Habe nun, ach, philosophie</i>,” was declaimed
the effect was tremendous. The scenes which followed were
less effective on the stage, except those where Gretchen appears.
One day we heard that a famous Italian actress was to perform
in Berlin. Her name was Eleonora Duse. We had never
heard her name mentioned, but the man who sold theatre
tickets said she was a rival of Sarah Bernhardt. She was to
open in the <i>Dame aux Camélias</i>. We took tickets, read the
play beforehand in German, as we neither of us knew Italian,
and we went on the first night. To see a play in a language
you do not understand, however well you know the story, takes
away half the pleasure, but we never had a doubt about the
quality of her art. The beauty and pathos of her death scene
were so great as to be independent of words and speech. Had
she been acting in Chinese the effect would have been just as
great. We saw her afterwards in the <i>Doll’s House</i>, in which
she was equally remarkable, and the scathing irony with which
she lashed Helmer, the husband, was unforgettable.</p>

<p>We also went to concerts, and once or twice to the opera, but
the opera in Berlin was not a good one.</p>

<p>I knew hardly any Germans while I was at Berlin. I had a
letter of introduction to a Frau von Arnim, and one night I had
dinner at her house. There were five or six officers present,
all in uniform, and one of them described a day’s hunting in
England, and said that the meet was crowded with <i>bildschöne
Frauen</i>. The Ambassador at Berlin was Sir Edward Mallet,
and he asked us to dinner sometimes.</p>

<p>It had been my intention to attend the lectures of the Berlin
University, and I was formally enrolled as a student. I matriculated
at the University, but the formalities before this was
accomplished were so long, that by the time they were finished, I
had little time left for a University career. However, I received
a card which placed me outside the jurisdiction of the Berlin
police and under the jurisdiction of the University authorities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but I only went to one lecture. I had private lessons in German
throughout my stay.</p>

<p>I read a good many miscellaneous books during my stay
in Berlin, and Arthur Ponsonby introduced me to many new
things, and opened many doors for me, especially in French
literature. He gave me Tolstoy and Loti to read, and we both
had a passion for Ibsen. I, on the other hand, plied him with
Pater, Stevenson, and Swinburne. I was just at the age when
one can digest anything in the way of books, and the sweeter it
is the more one enjoys it. Afterwards much of the stuff I was
greedily devouring then was to seem like the almond paste on
the top of a wedding-cake. But in those days nothing was too
luscious or too sweet. Arthur’s taste was already more sober
and grown-up; the drama appealed to both of us, and we would
spend hours discussing plays and players, and deploring the
state of the English stage.</p>

<p>At the end of December I went back to England and spent
the last Christmas but one at Membland I was ever to spend

<p>After Christmas I stayed a few days with Chérie at her
house at Cosham and with the Ponsonbys at the Isle
of Wight. Uncle Henry Ponsonby said he had taken
one book with him in the Crimean War, and he had read it
through. This was <i>Paradise Lost</i>. The conversation arose
from his quoting the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The mind is its own place, and in itself</div>
<div class="verse">Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and I happened to know where the quotation came from. I
stayed for a few days with the Bensons at Addington. Arthur
and Fred Benson were there, but none of the rest of the family.
Fred Benson had just finished his novel, <i>Dodo</i>, and was correcting
the proofs of it. I read the proofs. Arthur Benson
had written a great many poems, which he read out to me.
They were published later in the year. During the time I had
spent at Hildesheim I had continued to write verse every now
and then, and I used to send my efforts to Arthur Benson for
his criticism. I had also written what must have been a childish
play, a modern drama, but I had published nothing except a
little verse in a Plymouth newspaper. While I was staying
at Osborne with the Ponsonbys and also at Addington with the
Bensons I heard a great deal about a Miss Ethel Smyth. Arthur
Benson had told me about her at Eton. She was a friend of
his family, and he used often to hear from her. She was a
newer friend of my aunts and my cousins, and they talked a
great deal about her. I heard about her wonderful singing,
her energy, her vitality, her talk, how she had said that Mrs.
Benson was “as good as God and as clever as the Devil”;
how I must hear her sing “l’Anneau d’argent,” and her own
Mass. It was arranged that I was to make her acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Her Mass was to be given at the Albert Hall, and I was invited
by Mrs. Charles Hunter (Miss Smyth’s sister) to hear it from
her box. The box was full of Miss Smyth’s hunting friends,
who gave the music a respectful hearing, and when it was over
we went to the Bachelors’ Club and had supper. I sat next
to Miss Smyth and we made friends at once. The next night
I had dinner at Dover Street, where Mrs. Hunter was staying,
and there I met General Smyth, Miss Smyth’s father, and
Mr. Brewster, an American by birth, a Frenchman by education,
an Italian by residence. His appearance was striking; he
had a fair beard and the eyes of a seer; <i>à contre jour</i>, someone
said he looked like a Rembrandt. His manner was suave, and
at first one thought him inscrutable—a person whom one could
never know, surrounded as it were by a hedge of roses. When
I got to know him better I found the whole secret of
Brewster was this: he was absolutely himself: he said
quite simply and calmly what he thought. Nothing leads to
such misunderstandings as the truth. Bismarck said the best
of all diplomatic policies was to tell the truth, as nobody believed
you. But even when you are not prepared to disbelieve, and
suspect no diplomatic wiles, the truth is sometimes disconcerting
when calmly expressed. I recollect my first conversation with
Mr. Brewster. We talked of books, and I was brimful of
enthusiasm for Swinburne and Rossetti. “No,” said Brewster,
“I don’t care for Rossetti; it all seems to me like an elaborate
exercise. I prefer Paul Verlaine.” I knew he was not being
paradoxical, but I thought he was lacking in catholicity,
narrow in comprehension. Why couldn’t one like both? I
thought he was being Olympian and damping. When I got
to know him well, I understood how completely sincere he
had been, and how utterly unpretentious; how impossible
it was for him to pretend he liked something he did not like,
and how true it was that Rossetti seemed to him as elaborate
as an exercise.</p>

<p>That night we went to a concert at St. James’s Hall,
and I saw again the familiar green benches where for so many
years my mother had seats in Row 2. “You remind me,”
said a lady I was introduced to that night, “of a lady who
used to come and sit here at the Pops in the second row, a long
time ago.”</p>

<p>I can’t remember where it was I first heard Ethel Smyth sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whether it was in Dover Street or in her own little house, “One
Oak.” I remember the songs she sang—some Brahms, some
Schubert, among others “Pause” and “Der Doppelgänger,”
“l’Anneau d’argent,” and “Come o’er the Sea,” and I knew at
once that I had opened a window on a new and marvellous
province. The whole performance was so complete and so
poignantly perfect: the accompaniment, the way the words and
the music were blended, and the composer’s inmost and most
intimate intention and meaning seemed to be revealed and
interpreted as if he were singing the song himself for the first
time; the rare and exquisite quality and delicacy of her voice,
the strange thrill and wail, the distinction and distinct clear
utterance, where every word and every note told without effort,
and the whirlwind of passion and feeling she evoked in a song
such as “Come o’er the Sea” or Brahms’ “Botschaft.”</p>

<p>It was settled that I was to learn Italian, and for that purpose
I went to Florence. I stayed in Paris a few days on the
way at the Hôtel St. Romain, Rue St. Roch, and I went to
several plays and saw Bartet at the Théâtre français, in <i>Le
Père Prodigue</i>. Then I travelled to Florence in a crowded
second-class carriage. I had expected Florence to be a dismal
place, full of buildings like Dorchester House, grey and cold.
It was cold when the Tramontana blew, but I had forgotten
or rather I had not imagined the Italian sun. I arrived
late, at one in the morning, and when I got up and saw the sun
streaming from a cloudless blue sky on warm, yellow, sun-baked
houses with red flat roofs, I was amazed. I stayed the
first night I arrived at an hotel, and then moved into a pension
at Lung’Arno della Borsa 2 bis, which belonged to Signora
Agnese Traverso. I began to learn Italian at once, and had
lessons from a charming old Italian called Signor Benelli.
Signor Benelli had been a soldier in Garibaldi’s Army; he
was an intense enthusiast both in politics and literature—a
Dante scholar and an admirer of the moderns: Carducci,
and Gabriele d’Annunzio’s early poems, which were not well
known then. I never had a better master before or afterwards.
He knew English well and revelled in English poetry,
especially in Shelley and Keats. As soon as I got to understand
Italian we read Dante, and I read the whole of the <i>Divina
Commedia</i> aloud with Signor Benelli, all Leopardi, and a great
deal of Tasso and Ariosto. I also made other discoveries for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
myself in other branches of literature. There was a large
lending library at Florence, full of books in every European
literature. I there discovered by myself the works of Anatole
France and read <i>Thaïs</i>, <i>Balthazar</i>, and <i>L’Etui de Nacre</i>, <i>le
Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard</i>, and <i>La Rôtisserie de la Reine
Pédauque.</i> I read a great deal of Maupassant as well, the
complete works of Merimée, some Balzac, and the plays of
Dumas fils, and all the Sardou I could get hold of. I also had
a few Russian lessons from a lady, but I did not go on with
them as I had not the time. I made the acquaintance of
Miss Violet Paget (Vernon Lee), who lived in a lovely little
villa called “The Palmerino” on the Fiesole side of the town.</p>

<p>The spring in Florence is a wonderful pageant. At first
you do not see where there can be any room for it. The trees
seem all evergreen—cypresses and silvery olives. The landscape
seems complete as it is. Then suddenly the brown hills
are alive with wild, fluttering, red jagged-edged tulips. Large
bunches of anemones, violets, and lilies of the valley are sold
in the streets, and soon roses. Then the young corn shoots up,
and all the hills become green and the cornfields are fringed
with wild dog-roses, and soon the tall red and white lilies come
out, and then the wistaria, and the Judas trees—a dense mass of
blossom against the solid, speckless blue sky.</p>

<p>In May I met Hubert Cornish at Naples and spent a few
days with him, and we went for a night to Sorrento, and in
June I went to Venice by myself and stayed there for one long
and deliciously hot week. I saw the pictures, drifted about
on the lagoon, and bathed at the Lido in the Adriatic, the only
sea that is really hot enough.</p>

<p>At the end of June I was back again in England. I was to
go to Oxford or Cambridge, but to do either of these things
it is necessary to pass an examination in which sums had to be
done. At first I was going to Oxford, but it was thought that
I would never be able to pass Smalls, so it was decided I should
go to Cambridge, but in order to pass the examination before
matriculating I had to go to a crammer’s to brush up my Latin
and Greek and try to learn Arithmetic.</p>

<p>At the end of July I went to Eton and stayed with the
Cornishes. Mr. Cornish had just been made Vice-Provost, and
was moving into the Cloisters from Holland House. It was a
hot, beautiful August and we spent most of our days on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
river. One day there was a regatta going on at Datchet. As
we passed it we made triolets on the events of the regatta.
“My shirt is undone, here comes the regatta,” one of them
began. The incident that struck us most was the passage of
Miss Tarver in a boat. She appeared to be in distress, and was
weeping. This incident was at once put to verse in this triolet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! there’s Lily Tarver</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In oceans of tears,</div>
<div class="verse">Like streams of hot lava,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! there’s Lily Tarver!</div>
<div class="verse">The regatta’s loud <i>brava</i></div>
<div class="verse indent1">Still rings in her ears.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! there’s Lily Tarver</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In oceans of tears!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Arthur Benson’s one night I met Mr. Gosse, who
was kind to me, and from that moment became a lifelong
friend.</p>

<p>I had written an essay on Collins, and Arthur Benson had
sent it for me to <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i>. The editor did not
print it, but he wrote me a letter about it, urging me to
go on writing. While I had been at Florence I had written
a complete novel, which I had sent to the publishers. The
publishers’ reader reported that it was worth printing, and
offered to publish it on the half-profits system. I had the sense
to put it in the fire. Everyone, said Vernon Lee to me once,
should write a novel once, if only so as never to want to do
it again.</p>

<p>In August I went to Mr. Tatham, who lived near Abingdon,
to prepare for my examination. At his house several boys were
struggling with the same task and preparing to go to Oxford.
Mr. Tatham did not teach me arithmetic—nobody could do
that—but he taught me some Greek and Latin. We read
the <i>Plutus</i> of Aristophanes, and some Catullus, and he led
me into new fields in English literature. I enjoyed myself
at his house quite immensely. Sometimes at dinner Mr.
Tatham would laugh till tears poured down his cheeks, and
once he laughed so much that he was almost ill and had to go
upstairs to his room to recover.</p>

<p>We used to make up triolets at meals, and at all times of
the day, and while I was at Abingdon I had two little books of
them printed called <i>Northcourt Nonsense</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
One of them was written while dressing for dinner and after
having been stung by a fly, and addressed to Mr. Tatham and
sent to him by the maid. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“May I wear a silk tie</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To-night at the table?</div>
<div class="verse">I’ve been stung by a fly,</div>
<div class="verse">May I wear a silk tie?</div>
<div class="verse">I will bind it as high</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And as low as I’m able,</div>
<div class="verse">May I wear a silk tie</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To-night at the table?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to which Mr. Tatham at once sent this answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The tie that you wear</div>
<div class="verse indent1">May be wholly of silk,</div>
<div class="verse">Or of stuff or mohair,</div>
<div class="verse">The tie that you wear;</div>
<div class="verse">If the pain you can’t bear,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Better bathe it with milk,</div>
<div class="verse">The tie that you wear</div>
<div class="verse indent1">May be wholly of silk.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the boys who was preparing for Oxford was called
Ralli, and he had great facility as a planchette writer. He
could not write by himself, but as soon as anyone else put their
hands on planchette at the same time as he did, it would write
like mad. The things it wrote seemed to be nearly always
what he had read and forgotten, sometimes an article from
the <i>Figaro</i>, sometimes a passage from a French novel. Sometimes
it wrote verse. Ralli was a fluent poet, but wrote better
verse without the aid of planchette than with. Sometimes
the planchette board answered his questions, but with a flippant
inconsequence.</p>

<p>In October I went to Cambridge and passed into Trinity,
leaving the <i>Little Go</i> to be tackled later. I had rooms in Trinity
Street. Hubert Cornish was at King’s. I was to go in for the
Modern Language Tripos, which meant languages about as
modern as <i>Le Roman de la Rose</i> and Chaucer. I went to a
coach for mathematics, but this was sheer waste of time, as
not one word of what I was taught ever entered my brain, nor
did I improve one jot.</p>

<p>I belonged to two debating societies—the Magpie and
Stump, and the Decemviri—and used to speak at both of them
quite often; and to a society where one read out papers, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Chit-Chat. I also belonged to the A.D.C., and played the
part of the butler in <i>Parents and Guardians</i>, and that of the
footman in the <i>Duchess of Bayswater</i>.</p>

<p>In the summer term, during the May week, Hubert Cornish,
R. Austen Leigh, and myself edited an ephemeral newspaper
called the <i>Cambridge A B C</i>, which had four numbers and which
contained an admirable parody of Kipling by Carr-Bosanquet.</p>

<p>Here are some lines from it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“By Matyushin and Wilczek-land he is come to the Northern Pole,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose tap-roots bite on the Oolite and Palæozoic coal:</div>
<div class="verse">He set his hand and his haunch to the tree, he plucked it up by the root,</div>
<div class="verse">And the lines of longitude upward sprang like the broken chords of a lute;</div>
<div class="verse">And over against the Hills of Glass he came to the spate of stars,</div>
<div class="verse">And the Pole it sank, but he swam to bank and warmed himself on Mars;</div>
<div class="verse">Till he came to the Reeling Beaches between the night and the day,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the tall king crabs like hansom cabs and the black bull lobsters lay.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aubrey Beardsley was just becoming known as an artist,
and we wrote to him and asked him to design a cover, never
thinking he would consent to do so. He did, for the modest
sum of ten guineas, and many people thought it was a clever
parody of his draughtsmanship.</p>

<p>At Trinity, Carr-Bosanquet was the shining light of the
Decemviri Debating Society. At Eton he had edited the
<i>Parachute</i>, which was far the best schoolboy periodical that
had appeared there for years, and had written, in collaboration
with two other boys, a book called <i>Seven Summers</i>, about Eton,
which was afterwards withdrawn from circulation because for
some reason or other the authorities objected to it. Next
to <i>A Day of my Life at Eton</i> it is the best book about Eton
life that has ever been written, and the only book of its kind.
It certainly ought to be republished. The curious thing is that
the objections to it, which to the lay mind are not perceptible
(for a more harmless book was never written), were only made
after it had been published for some time.</p>

<p>Carr-Bosanquet used often to contribute poems of a light
kind about topical events to the <i>Eton Chronicle</i>, and at Cambridge
he wrote as wittily as he talked and spoke. He had
rather a dry, kind sense of humour, saltlike sense, and an Attic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wit, which pervaded his talk, his speeches, his finished and
scholarly verse. We thought he was certain to be a bright
star in English literature, a successor to Praed and Calverley,
and perhaps to Charles Lamb; but his career was distinguished
in another line—archæology—and he allowed himself no rival
pursuit. Had he opted for literature, and the province of the
witty essay and the light rhyme, he certainly could have achieved
great things, as he had already done far more than show promise.
His performance as far as it went was already mature, finished,
and of a high order. There was at Trinity and at King’s at
this time, as I suppose there is at all times, a small but highly
intellectual world, of which the apex was the mysterious
Society of the Apostles, who discussed philosophy in secret.
I skirted the fringe of this world, and knew some of its
members: Bertrand Russell, the mathematician; Robert
Trevelyan, the poet; and others. One day, one of these intellectuals
explained to me that I ought not to go to Chapel, as
it was setting a bad example. Christianity was exploded, a
thing of the past; nobody believed in it really among the young
and the advanced, but for the sake of the old-fashioned and the
unregenerate I was bidden to set an example of sincerity and
courage, and soon the world would follow suit. I remember
thinking that although I was much younger in years than
these intellectuals, and far inferior in knowledge, brains, and
wits, no match for them in argument or in achievement, I was
none the less older than they were in a particular kind of experience—the
experience that has nothing to do either with the
mind, or with knowledge, and that is independent of age, but
takes place in the heart, and in which a child may be sometimes
more rich than a grown-up person. I do not mean anything
sentimental. I am speaking of the experience that comes
from having been suddenly constrained to turn round and look
at life from a different point of view. So when I heard the
intellectuals reason in the manner I have described, I felt for
the moment an old person listening to young people. I felt
young people must always have talked like that. It was not
that I had then any definite religious creed. I seldom went to
Chapel, but that was out of laziness. I seldom went to church
in London, and never of my own accord.</p>

<p>While I was at Heidelberg the religious tenets which I had
kept absolutely intact since childhood, without question and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
without the shadow of doubt or difficulty, suddenly one day,
without outside influence or inward crisis, just dropped away
from me. I shed them as easily as a child loses a first tooth.
In the winter of 1893, when I came back from Berlin, someone
asked me why I didn’t go to church. I said it was because I
didn’t believe in a Christian faith, and that if I were ever to
again I would be a Catholic. That seemed to me the only
logical and indeed the inevitable consequence of such a belief.
In spite of this, dogmatic disbelief was to me always an intolerable
thing, and when I heard the intellectuals talk in the
manner I have described, I used to feel that people like Dr.
Johnson had known better than they, but that in his day it
was probable that the young and he himself talked like that;
it was one of the privileges of youth. I did not say this,
however. I kept my thoughts to myself. I remember my
spoken answer being that I did not care if my landlady thought
an upright poker placed in front of the fire made it burn or not.
If she liked to believe that, it was her affair. I didn’t mind if
she worshipped the poker.</p>

<p>At King’s my great friends were Hubert Cornish, Ramsay,
who was afterwards Lower Master at Eton, and R⸺ A⸺,
the son of a distinguished soldier. A. was the most original of
all the undergraduates I knew. He was a real scholar, with
the most eclectic and rather austere taste in literature, and a
passion for organ music. He was shy and fastidious beyond
words. He could not endure being shaved at Cambridge, and
used to go up to London twice a week for that purpose. He
took no part in any of the clubs or societies. At the same
time he was a devoted friend and a fiery patriot. He was so
difficult to please about his own work that when he went up for
his Tripos and had to do a set of Latin hexameters, he showed
up a series of unfinished lines, “pathetic half-lines,” a suggested
end of hexameter, a possible beginning, the hint of a cæsura,
a few epithets, and here and there an almost perfect line, with
a footnote to say “these verses are not meant to scan.” He
was a bibliophile, but collected faded second editions and never
competed. He had a passionate admiration for Thomas Hardy’s
works, and a great deference for the opinion of his friends.
One day when he was discussing literature with Hubert Cornish,
Hubert said he liked a book which A. disliked. When A. heard
this he said gently: “Of course if you like it, Hubert, I like it too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This all happened in the period of the ’nineties. When
people write about the ’nineties now, which they often do,
they seem to me to weave a baseless legend and to create a
fantastic world of their own creation. The ’nineties were, from
the point of view of art and literature, much like any other
period. If you want to know what literary conversation was
like in the ’nineties you can hear it any day at the Reform Club.
If you compare the articles on literature or art that appeared
in the <i>Speaker</i> of 1892-3 with the articles in the <i>New Statesman</i>
of 1921, you will find little difference between the two.
The difference between the <i>Yellow Book</i> and periodicals of the
same kind (<i>The Owl</i>, for instance), which were started years
later, was chiefly in the colour of the cover. The fact is there
are only a certain number of available writers in London,
and whenever a new periodical is started, all the available
writers are asked to contribute; so in the <i>Yellow Book</i> you had
practically the available writers of the time contributing—Henry
James, Edmund Gosse, George Moore, Crackenthorpe,
William Watson, John Davidson, John Oliver Hobbes, Vernon
Lee, Le Gallienne, Arthur Benson, Arthur Symons, and Max
Beerbohm. I think there is seldom any startling difference
between the literature of one decade and another. When
I was at Cambridge, England was said by the newspapers to
be a nest of singing birds; again the same thing was said when
the Georgian poets began to publish their work; but the same
thing might be said of any epoch. Throughout the whole of
English history there never has been a period, as yet, when
England was not a nest of singing birds, and when a great
quantity of verse, good, bad, and indifferent, was not being
poured out. But it was said in the ’nineties that poetry was a
paying business; second-hand booksellers were speculating
in the first editions of the new poets, just as they do now; and
to get the complete works of one poet, who had published
little, one had to pay a hundred pounds. A society called the
Rhymers’ Club published two books called respectively the
<i>Book of the Rhymers’ Club</i>, and the <i>Second Book of the Rhymers’
Club</i>, both of which were anthologies by living authors, and
somewhat the same in intention as the <i>Books of Georgian Poetry</i>.
Both these books are now rare and sought after by collectors.
It is interesting to look at them now, and to look back in general
on the poets of that day, and to see what has survived and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
has been forgotten. These two anthologies by no means
represented the whole of the poetic output and production of
the day. They were not comprehensive anthologies of all the
living poets, but the manifesto of one small Poetical Club.
Taking a general bird’s-eye view of literature and the literary
world of that day, this is what you would have noted. Tennyson
was just dead. Swinburne was still writing, and published
some of the finer poems of his later manner in a volume called
<i>Astrophel</i>, in 1894. Stevenson was alive, and had just published
<i>The Ebb Tide</i>. Meredith had but lately come into his own,
and was hailed by old and young. <i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i>
had enlarged the public of Thomas Hardy. Robert Bridges
was issuing fastidious pamphlets of verse printed by Mr. Beeching
at Oxford. Christina Rossetti was alive. Mr. Kipling
published what are perhaps his greatest achievements in the
short story in <i>Life’s Handicap</i> in 1891, and his <i>Many Inventions</i>
came out in 1892. His <i>Barrack Room Ballads</i> were published
in 1892. His loud popularity among the public was endorsed
by critics such as Henry James, Edmund Gosse, and Andrew
Lang. Andrew Lang was still writing “books like <i>Genesis</i> and
sometimes for the <i>Daily News</i>,” besides a monthly causerie in
<i>Longman’s Magazine</i>, and a weekly causerie in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>. Mrs. Humphry Ward’s <i>David Grieve</i> was published
in 1892 and acclaimed by the whole press. Edmund
Gosse was collecting and preparing a volume of the verse of his
maturity (published in 1894), and once a year produced a
volume of delicate and perspicuous prose. Henley was writing
patriotic verse and barbed prose in the <i>National Observer</i>, which
was full of spirited, scholarly and brilliant writing. Charles
Whibley was making a name. Max Beerbohm was making his
début. William Watson was discovered as a real new poet, and
his “Wordsworth’s Grave,” and his “Lachrymæ Musarum” won
praise from the older critics, and attracted, for verse, great attention.
He was named as a possible laureate. John Davidson was
said to have inspiration and fire, and to have written a fine
ballad; Norman Gale’s <i>Country Lyrics</i> were praised; Arthur
Benson represented the extreme right of English poetry, and
Arthur Symons the extreme left. Wilde had published a play
in French, and his <i>Lady Windermere’s Fan</i> was hailed as the
best comedy produced on the English stage since Congreve.
Pinero had startled London with his <i>Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and the discovery of Mrs. Patrick Campbell. In the <i>Speaker</i>
Quiller-Couch wrote a weekly causerie, and George Moore put
some of his best work in weekly articles on art, and Mr.
Walkley some of his wittiest writing in weekly articles on the
stage. Henry James was struggling with the stage, and John
Oliver Hobbes was making a name as a coiner of epigrams.
Harry Cust was editing the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> and concocting
delightful leaders out of the classics, with fantastic titles. E. F.
Benson had published <i>Dodo</i>. Turning from the general to the
particular, and to the <i>Book of the Rhymers’ Club</i>, published in
1892, the names of the contributors were: Ernest Dowson,
Edwin Ellis, C. A. Greene, Lionel Johnson, Richard le Gallienne,
Victor Plarr, Ernest Radford, Ernest Rhys, T. W. Rolleston,
Arthur Symons, John Todhunter, and W. B. Yeats. In the
second series the same names occur with an additional one—Arthur
Cecil Hillier.</p>

<p>A reaction against supposed foreign influences was started
and preached, and Richard le Gallienne called his book of verse
<i>English Lyrics</i> to accentuate this; but it is difficult to find any
trace of this foreign influence in the verse of that day, except in
some of the poems of Arthur Symons. When people write of
the ’nineties now, they say that the verse of that period is all
about pierrots, powder, and patchouli. The reason is perhaps
that the most startling feature in the creative art of the period
was the genius of Aubrey Beardsley, whose perfect draughtsmanship
seemed to be guided by a malignant demon. I have looked
through the <i>Books of the Rhymers’ Club</i> carefully, and I cannot
find a single allusion to a pierrot, or even to a powder-puff.
Here are the titles of some of the subjects: “Carmelite Nuns
of Perpetual Adoration”; “Love and Death”; “The Pathfinder”;
“The Broken Tryst”; “A Ring’s Secret”; “A
Burden of Easter Vigil”; “Father Gilligan”; “In Falmouth
Harbour”; “Mothers of Men”; “Sunset in the City”;
“Lost”; “To a Breton Beggar”; “Song in the Labour
Movement”; “Saint Anthony”; “Lady Macbeth”; “Midsummer
Day”; “The Old Shepherd”; “The Night Jar”;
“The Song of the Old Mother”; “The First Spring Day”;
“An Ode to Spring.” These subjects seem to me singularly
like those that have inspired poets of all epochs; it is difficult
to detect anything peculiar to the ’nineties in a title such as
“The First Spring Day,” or “A Ring’s Secret.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The first <i>Rhymers’ Book</i> contains Yeats’ exquisite poem on
the Lake of Innisfree, and some dignified verse by Lionel
Johnson; the second series contains a well-known poem by
Ernest Dowson: “I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my
fashion.” But I think I am right in saying that it was neither
Yeats nor Lionel Johnson nor Dowson’s work in these anthologies
that attracted the greatest attention, but a lyric of Le
Gallienne’s called “What of the Darkness?” which I remember
one critic said wiped out Tennyson’s lyrics. Tennyson’s lyrics,
however, went on obstinately existing, no doubt so as to give
another generation the pleasure of thinking that they had
wiped them out. While these singing birds were twittering,
I remember one day at Cambridge buying a new book of verse
by a man called Francis Thompson. Here, I thought, is another
of the hundreds of new poets, but directly I caught sight
of the “Hound of Heaven,” I thought to myself “Here is something
different.” I remember showing Hubert Cornish a poem
called “Daisy,” and saying to him, “Isn’t this very good?”
It begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Where the thistle lifts a purple crown</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Six foot out of the turf,</div>
<div class="verse">And the harebell shakes on the windy hill,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">O the breath of the distant surf.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” said Hubert, “but the trouble is that everyone
writes so well nowadays that it is hardly worth while for any
new poet to write well. All can raise the flower because all have
got the seed.”</p>

<p>The undergraduates had no great enthusiasm for any of
these new writers. I mean the intellectuals among the undergraduates.
But the booksellers were always urging us to buy
them on the plea that they would go up. Some of them did,
and those who speculated in Francis Thompson and Yeats did
well. The curious thing is that the prose writers and the
poets were supposed to be great sticklers for form, to be
absorbed by the theory of art for art’s sake, and to be
aiming at impeccable craftsmanship. Looking back on the
work of those poets now, their technique, compared to that
of more modern poets, seems almost ludicrously feeble, but
they seem to have had just what they were supposed to be
without: a burning ideal to serve literature; to have been
consumed with the desire to bring about a renaissance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
English literature and an <i>English</i> renaissance. There was one
poet’s name which was sometimes mentioned then, and which
had come down to the ’nineties from other and older generations.
The name has gone on being mentioned since, and will one day,
I think, reach the safe harbour of lasting fame, and this was
Michael Field. Michael Field was a pseudonym which covered
the remarkable personalities of two ladies, an aunt and a niece,
who were friends of Robert Browning and of all the literary
lights of their day, and who wrote a series of most remarkable
dramas in verse and some extremely beautiful lyrics.</p>

<p>John Lane, the publisher, used to come down to Cambridge
sometimes, and I made his acquaintance and, through him and
Mr. Gosse, that of many of the writers I have mentioned:
John Davidson, Le Gallienne, and others. There was a society
at this time in London called the Cemented Bricks, to which
some of the <i>littérateurs</i> and poets belonged, which met at
Anderton’s Hotel in Fleet Street, and I was made a member,
and on one occasion made a speech, and was down to read
a paper, but I had to go abroad and this never came off. But
what I chiefly remember about it is one occasion when Le
Gallienne read a paper in which he passionately attacked the
theory of art for art’s sake, and insisted on the relative unimportance
of art compared with Nature, saying that a branch of
almond blossom against the sky was worth all the pictures in
the world. His paper was answered a month later by a young
man who said this was the most Philistine sentiment he had
ever heard expressed. This was while I was at Cambridge.</p>

<p>I did little work at Cambridge, and from the Cambridge
curriculum I learnt nothing. I attended lectures on mathematics
which might just as well have been, for the good they
did me, in Hebrew. I spent hours with a coach who wearily
explained to me things which I didn’t and couldn’t understand.
I went to some lectures on French literature, but all I
remember of them is that the lecturer demonstrated at some
length that the French written by many well-known authors
was often ungrammatical and sometimes full of mistakes.
The lecturer cited to support his case pages of Georges Ohnet.
One hardly needed a lecturer to point out that Georges
Ohnet was not a classical writer. The lecturer’s aim was not
to show the badness of certain authors, but to prove that the
French of modern current literature was an independent living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
organism that was growing and developing heedless of classical
models, grammatical rules, and academic authority. I think
he would have done better had he pointed out how certain
other authors were writing prose and verse of so great an excellence
that in the course of time their works might become
classics. Boileau was one of the books to be read for the Tripos,
and I had already read a great deal of Boileau and learnt his verse
by heart as a child. I copied out the following lines in 1888:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hélas! qu’est devenu ce temps, cet heureux temps,</div>
<div class="verse">Où les rois s’honoraient du nom de fainéants;</div>
<div class="verse">S’endormaient sur le trône, et, me servant sans honte,</div>
<div class="verse">Laissaient leur sceptre aux mains ou d’un maire ou d’un comte?</div>
<div class="verse">Aucun soin n’approchait de leur paisible cour:</div>
<div class="verse">On reposait la nuit, on dormait tout le jour.</div>
<div class="verse">Seulement au printemps, quand Flore dans les plaines</div>
<div class="verse">Faisaient taire des vents les bruyantes haleines,</div>
<div class="verse">Quatre bœufs attelés, d’un pas tranquille et lent,</div>
<div class="verse">Promenaient dans Paris le monarque indolent.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When I told Dr. Verrall that we were reading Boileau he was
delighted. He said: “How I wish I was reading Boileau;
instead of which, when I have time to read, I read the latest
Kipling story.” He said he spent his life in vain regret for
the books he wanted to read, but which he knew he never
would read. He could not help reading the modern books,
but he often deplored the sad necessity. I stuck up for the
modern books; I said I would far rather read Kipling than
Boileau. I supposed in Boileau’s time people said: “Here I
am, wasting my time reading Boileau, which I must read so as
to follow the conversation at dinner, when I might be reading
<i>le Roman de la Rose</i>.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verrall was an amusing story-teller, and I remember
his telling a story of two old ladies who, while they were
listening to the overture of <i>Lohengrin</i>, looked at each other
with a puzzled, timid expression, until one of them asked
the other: “Is it the gas?” Dr. Verrall told me he
thought Rossetti’s poem, the “Blessed Damozel,” was
rubbish. On the other hand, he admired his ballad, “Sister
Helen.”</p>

<p>He said: “Why did you melt your waxen man, Sister
Helen?” was a magnificent opening to a poem.</p>

<p>In spite of having learnt nothing in an academic sense at
Cambridge, I am glad I went there, and I think I learnt a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
deal in other ways. I look back on it and I see the tall trees
just coming out in the backs, behind King’s College; a picnic
in canoes on the Cam; bookshops, especially a dark, long
bookshop in Trinity Street where a plaintive voice told one
that Norman Gale would be sure to go up; little dinner-parties
in my rooms in Trinity Street, the food arriving on a tray from
the College kitchen where the cook made <i>créme brûlée</i> better
than anyone else in the world; one night fireworks on the window-sill
and the thin curtains ablaze; rehearsals for the A.D.C.,
and Mr. Clarkson making one up; long, idle mornings in
Trinity and King’s; literary discussions in rooms at Trinity;
debates of the Decemviri in Carr-Bosanquet’s room on the
ground floor of the Great Court; summer afternoons in
King’s College gardens, and the light streaming through the
gorgeous glass of the west window in King’s Chapel, where,
listening to the pealing anthem, I certainly never dreamed of
taxing the royal Saint with vain expense; gossip at the Pitt
Club in the mornings, crowds of youths with well-brushed hair
and straw hats telling stories in front of the fireplace; the
Sunday-evening receptions in Oscar Browning’s rooms full of
Arundel prints and crowds of long-haired Bohemians; the
present Provost of Eton mimicking the dons; and the endless
laughter of those who could say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We were young, we were merry, we were very, very wise,</div>
<div class="verse">And the door stood open to our feast.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I left Cambridge after my first summer term as I could not
pass the Little Go, nor could I ever have done so, had I stayed
at Cambridge for years. My life during the next five years
was a prolonged and arduous struggle to pass the examination
into the Diplomatic Service. When I left Cambridge I
went to Versailles, and stayed there a month to work at
French. Then after a few days at Contrexéville, with my
father, I went back to Hildesheim and stopped at Bayreuth
on the way.</p>

<p>That year <i>Parsifal</i> and <i>Tannhäuser</i> were given, and for the
first time at Bayreuth, <i>Lohengrin</i>. Mottl conducted; Vandyk
sang the part of Lohengrin. When I arrived at the station,
after a long night’s journey, I was offered a place for the performance
of <i>Parsifal</i> that afternoon. I took it, but I was so
tired after the journey that I fell asleep during the first act, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
slept so soundly, that at the end of the act, I had to be shaken
before I woke up. In the third act, it will be remembered that
Lohengrin, when he reveals his parentage, his occupation, and
his name, at Elsa’s ill-timed request, mentions that his father’s
name was Parsifal. A German lady who was sitting near me,
when she heard this, gave a gasp of relief and recognition, as
if all were now plain, and sighed: “<i>Ach der Parsifal!</i>”</p>

<p>At Leipzig I ran short of money, and nobody would
cash me a cheque, as I could not satisfy either the Hotel
or the Bank or the British Consul (Baron Tauchnitz) that
I was who I claimed to be. I telegraphed to the Timmes
for money, and they sent it to the Bank for me by telegram,
but even then the Bank refused to give it to me, as they were
doubtful of my identity. Finally I got the Timmes to telegraph
it to the Hotel. The Consul was annoyed, and said that
Englishmen always appeared to think they could go where
they liked and do what they liked. I told him this was the
case, and I had always supposed it to be the duty of a British
Consul to help them to do so. I stayed at Hildesheim till Mr.
Scoones’ establishment for candidates for the Diplomatic Service
examination opened at Garrick Chambers in London in September.
The examination for the Diplomatic Service was
competitive. Candidates had to qualify in each of twelve
subjects, which included three modern languages, Latin,
modern history, geography, arithmetic, précis-writing, English
essay-writing, and shorthand. The standard in French and
German was high, and the most difficult task was the translation
of a passage from a <i>Times</i> leading article into French and
German as it was dictated. Life at Scoones’ meant going to
lectures from ten till one, and again in the afternoon, and being
crammed at home by various teachers. Mr. Scoones was a fine
organiser and an acute judge of character. He was half French,
and his personality was electric and fascinating; he was
light in hand, amusing, and full of point. He used to have
luncheon every day at the Garrick Club, which was next door to
Garrick Chambers, and he lectured himself on French. He was
assisted by the Rev. Dawson Clarke, who in vain tried to teach
me arithmetic, and did manage to teach me enough geography,
after five years, to qualify, and Mr. J. Allen, who gave us brilliant
lectures on modern history. There was also a charming French
lecturer, M. Esclangon, who corrected our French essays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The first time I wrote him an essay he wrote on it: “Le
Français est non seulement pur mais élégant.”</p>

<p>I lived alone in a room at the top of 37 Charles Street, and
worked in the winter months extremely hard. Special coaches
used to come to me, and special teachers of arithmetic. One of
them had a new system of teaching arithmetic, which was supposed
to make it simple, but in my case the system broke down.</p>

<p>Mr. Scoones told my father after I had been there a little
time that I was sure to pass eventually.</p>

<p>On Sunday evenings I used often to have supper with
Edmund Gosse at his house in Delamere Terrace, and there I
met some of the lights of the literary world: George Moore,
Rider Haggard, Henry Harland, and Max Beerbohm. Sometimes
there would be serious discussions on literature between
George Moore, Edmund Gosse, and Arthur Symons. I remember
once, when Swinburne was being discussed, Arthur
Symons saying that there was a period in everyone’s life when
one thought Swinburne’s poetry not only the best, but the only
poetry worth reading. It seemed then to annihilate all other
verse. Edmund Gosse then said that he would not be at all
surprised, if some day Swinburne’s verse were to appear almost
unintelligible to future generations. He thought it possible
that Swinburne might survive merely as a literary curiosity,
like Cowley. He also said that Swinburne in his later manner
was like a wheel that spun round and round without any
intellectual cog.</p>

<p>George Moore in those days was severe on Guy de Maupassant,
and said his stories were merely carved cherry-stones.
Edmund Gosse contested this point hotly. Still more amusing
than the literary discussions were those occasions when
Edmund Gosse would tell us reminiscences of his youth, when
he worked as a boy at the British Museum, and of the early
days of his friendship with Swinburne.</p>

<p>There was an examination for the Diplomatic Service that
autumn, and I was given a nomination for it, but I was ill and
couldn’t compete.</p>

<p>I went back to Hildesheim for Christmas. Christmas is
the captain jewel of German domestic life, and no one who has
not spent a Christmas with a German family can really know
Germany, just as no one who has not lived through the Easter
festival with a Russian family can really know Russia. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
only in Germany that the Christmas tree grows in its full glory.
The Christmas tree at Hildesheim was laden with little tangerine
oranges and sprinkled over with long threads of silver snow.
When it was lighted, the carol: “<i>Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht</i>,”
was sung round it. The presents were arranged, or rather
displayed, on a table under the tree: new presents, and a
present of many years’ standing, the <i>Puppenstube</i>, which took
on a new life every Christmas by being redecorated, and having
the small kitchen utensils in its dolls’ kitchen refurbished. The
presents were not wrapped up in parcels, but they were exposed
to the full view of those who were about to receive them, and
so arranged that they appeared at their very best, as though
Santa Claus and a fairy godmother had arranged them themselves.
My present was a beautiful embossed dicky.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve, the Christmas tree was relit, and as the
bells rang for New Year, we clinked glasses of punch and said:
“<i>Prosit Neujahr</i>.” If you want to know what is the spirit of
a German Christmas you will find its quintessence distilled in
the poem of Heine about “<i>Die heil’gen drei Kon’ge aus Morgenland</i>,”
which ends:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Der Stern blieb stehn über Joseph’s Haus,</div>
<div class="verse">Da sind sie hineingegangen;</div>
<div class="verse">Das Ochslein brüllte, das Kindlein schrie,</div>
<div class="verse">Die heil’gen drei Könige sangen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While I was going through this complicated and protracted
training, the date of the examination was, of course, only a
matter of conjecture, but when an Ambassador died there
was always an atmosphere of excitement at Garrick Chambers,
and on Scoones’ face one could clearly read that something
momentous had occurred. As a rule the examinations
happened about once a year. Having missed my first chance,
which was fortunate, as I was woefully unprepared, I had
to wait a long time for my second chance, and I spent
the time between London, which meant Garrick Chambers,
Germany, which meant Hildesheim, and Italy, which meant
Madame Traverso’s pension at Lung’Arno della Borsa 2 bis, at
Florence.</p>

<p>One night, at Edmund Gosse’s, in the winter of 1895, Harland
was there, and the conversation turned on Anatole France. I
quoted him some passages from <i>Le Livre de Mon Ami</i>, which he
had not read. The name of Anatole France had not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
been mentioned in the literary press of London, and Harland
said to me: “Why don’t you write me an article about him
and I will print it in the <i>Yellow Book</i>?” The <i>Yellow Book</i> by
that time had lost any elements of surprise or newness it had
ever had and had developed into an ordinary review to which
the stock writers of London reviews contributed. I said I
would try, and I wrote an article on Anatole France, which was
accepted by Harland and came out in the April number. This
was the first criticism of Anatole France which appeared in
England. In the same number there was a story by Anatole
France himself, and a long poem by William Watson. When
the proof of my article came, I took it to Edmund Gosse, and
read it aloud to him in his office at the Board of Trade in Whitehall.
He was pleased with it, and his meed of generous and
discriminating praise and encouragement was extremely welcome
and exhilarating. He said there was a unique opportunity for
anyone who should make it his aim and business to write gracefully
and delicately about beautiful and distinguished things,
and that I could not do better than try to continue as I had
begun. No one could have been kinder nor more encouraging.
The University is not a stimulating place for aspiring
writers. The dons have seen it all before so many times, and
heard it all so often; the undergraduates are so terribly in
earnest and uncompromisingly severe about the efforts of their
fellow-undergraduates; so cocksure and certain in their judgments,
so that at Cambridge I hid my literary aspirations, and
when I left it I had partially renounced all such ambitions,
thinking that I had been deluding myself, but at the same time
cherishing a hidden hope that I might some day begin again.
Edmund Gosse’s praise kindled the smouldering ashes and
prevented them from being extinguished, although I was too
busy learning arithmetic, geography, and long lists of obscure
terms in French and German to think much about such
things.</p>

<p>One night that winter I went with my father and my sisters
to the first night of the <i>Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith</i> at the Garrick
Theatre. Sir John Hare and Mrs. Patrick Campbell both
played magnificently, and Mrs. Campbell enjoyed a triumph.
She held the audience at the beginning of the play by her grace,
and by her quiet magnetic intensity, and then swept everyone
off their feet by her outbursts of vituperation. Mr. Shaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
writing in the <i>Saturday Review</i> about it, said that one of the
defects of the play, the unreality of the chief female character,
had “the lucky effect of setting Mrs. Patrick Campbell free
to do as she pleases in it, the result being an irresistible projection
of that lady’s personal genius, a projection which sweeps
the play aside and imperiously becomes the play itself. Mrs.
Patrick Campbell, in fact, pulls her author through by playing
him clean off the stage. She creates all sorts of illusions, and
gives one all sorts of searching sensations. It is impossible
not to feel that those haunting eyes are brooding on a momentous
past, and the parting lips anticipating a thrilling imminent
future, whilst some enigmatic present must no less surely be
working underneath all that subtle play of limb and stealthy
intensity of tone.” After the third act the audience applauded
deliriously, and the next day the critics declared unanimously
that Mrs. Campbell had the ball at her feet. They all prophesied
that this was the beginning of undreamed-of triumphs. They
little dreamed how recklessly she would kick the ball.</p>

<p>At Easter I went to Florence once more and stayed there
far into June. I think it was that year I spent a little time at
Perugia. One day I drove to Assisi. The country was in the
full glory of spring. We passed groaning carts drawn by slow,
white oxen; poppies flared in the green corn; little lizards
sunned themselves on the walls; one felt one was no longer in
Italy, but in an older country, in Latium; in some little kingdom
in which Remus might have been king, or that kindly monarch,
Numa Pompilius, with Egeria, his gracious consort. I saw the
Italy that I had dreamt of ever since as a child I had read with
Mrs. Christie in the <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i> of “where sweet
Clanis wanders through corn and vines and flowers,” of milk-white
steer grazing along Clitumnus, and the struggling sheep
plunging in Umbro. And when at last Assisi appeared, with
its shining snow-white basilica crowning the hill like a diadem,
one seemed to be driving up to a celestial city.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, life was made exciting by an earthquake.
It happened about nine o’clock in the evening. We
had just finished dinner at the pension. I had walked to my
bedroom to fetch something, when there came a noise like a
gas explosion or a bomb exploding, and I was thrown on to my
bed. The pictures fell from the walls, and the ground seemed
to be slipping away from one. Outside on the landing—we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
lived on the second floor of the Palazzo Alberti, up two flights
of stairs—I heard the servants crying: “<i>Sono i Ladri</i>” (“The
thieves are upon us”), and there was a scamper down the stairs,
as the maid and the cook rushed down to bolt the front door
and keep out the thieves. Then various objects of value were
saved, or at least a mysterious process of salvage was begun.
A box containing family deeds was carried from one room to
another, and some American children were carried downstairs
in a blanket. The shock, I think, lasted only seven seconds,
but had been, while it lasted, intense. Then there was a good
deal of bustle and discussion, and everybody suggested something
different that ought to be done; and Madame Traverso
carried on a conversation with the landlady of the house, who
lived on the first floor. Relations between the two households
had hitherto been strained, and a state of veiled hostilities had
existed between them. The earthquake changed all this and
brought about a reconciliation. From her window Madame
Traverso called to the landlady and assured her that we were:
“<i>Nelle mani di Dio</i>” (“We are in the hands of God”). “<i>Si</i>,”
answered the landlady: “<i>Siamo nelle mani di Dio</i>” (“Yes,
we are in the hands of God”). Signora Traverso said we could
not sleep in the house that night. It was not to be thought
of, and we joined the population in the streets. No sooner had
people begun to say it was all over, and that we could quietly
go home, than another faint tremor was felt. People encamped
in carriages; others walked about the streets. The terror
inspired by an earthquake is unlike any other, because you feel
there is no possible escape from it. At eleven o’clock in the
evening there was another faint shock. We got to bed late;
some of the inmates of the pension slept in a cab. The next
day one could inspect the damage done. The village of
Grassina near the Certosa had been destroyed. I had just
been to the Certosa, and one of the monks there, an Irishman,
when we asked him what the green liqueur was made of, that
he sold, said: “Shamrocks and melted emeralds.” Grassina
was a village where on Good Friday I had seen the procession
of <i>Gesù Morto</i> by torchlight, in the April twilight, with its
centurions in calico and armour, its tapers, its nasal brasses
and piercing lamentation, and crowd of nut-sellers; a ceremony
as old as the soil, and said to be a new incarnation of the
funeral of Pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The Palazzo Strozzi was rent from top to bottom with a
huge crack. Pillars in Piazza dell’Anunziata had fallen down;
and at San Miniato, the school of the Poggio Imperiale had been
seriously damaged. Had the shock lasted a few seconds longer
the destruction in Florence would have been extremely serious,
and many irreplaceable treasures would have been destroyed.</p>

<p>The afternoon after the earthquake I bicycled out to see
Vernon Lee, and she said that the butcher boy in her village
declared that in the afternoon before the earthquake he had
seen the Devil leap from a cleft in the ground in a cloud of
sulphurous fumes and fires. In the night there was another
slight shock towards one in the morning. I was asleep and
I was woken suddenly, and experienced the strange sensation
of feeling the floor slightly oscillating, but it only lasted a
second or two, and that was the last of the earthquake.</p>

<p>I made that year the acquaintance of Professor Nencioni,
a poet and a critic, and a profound student of English
literature and English verse. He was saturated with English
literature, and his poems show the influence and impress of the
English poets of the nineteenth century. He used to give
lectures on English poetry in Italian; he was a stimulating,
eloquent lecturer, and his knowledge of English was amazing.
I went to his lectures and made his acquaintance, and we had
long talks about literature. He asked me if I had written
anything, and I told him I had some typed poems, but that I
had given up trying to write verse. He asked me to show them
him. The next time I went to his lecture I took my typed
MSS. and left it with him. The next Sunday after the lecture
he came up to me with the MSS. in his hand and said: “<i>Lei
è poeta</i>,” and he said: “Never mind what anyone may tell
you, <i>I</i> tell you it is a fact.” I was greatly exhilarated by
Nencioni’s encouragement, but I thought that being a foreigner
he was perhaps too indulgent, and I would have felt uncomfortable
had a Cambridge undergraduate overheard his conversation.
It had nevertheless an effect, and I thought that
I would some day try to write verse again.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the summer, I went back to Germany.
Edward Marsh joined me at Hildesheim and stayed at the
Timmes’. E. was the most painstaking and industrious
pupil Professor Timme ever had, and he enjoyed the German
life to the full, but it was his misfortune rather than his fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that he offended the easily ruffled susceptibilities of the Timme
family.</p>

<p>On one occasion he made what turned out to be an unfortunate
remark about the river Innerste, which is Hildesheim’s
river. He said it was dirty; upon which Professor Timme,
much nettled, said: “<i>Das will ich nicht sagen. Sie ist viel
reiner als mancher Fluss, der von einer Grosstadt kommt, und
vielleicht ganz rein aussieht.</i>” [I won’t say that; it is much
cleaner than many a river that comes from a big town and
perhaps <i>looks</i> quite clean.]</p>

<p>There was a delightful German pupil living in the house
called Erich Wippern, a brother of Hans Wippern, who had
been there before. We arranged to give a <i>Kneipe</i> for him
and the other boys in one of the villages. The matter had been
publicly discussed and seemed to be settled, but at the last
minute, Professor Timme objected to it, and we had a long and
painful interview on the subject. He said the <i>Kneipe</i> was not
to be, and when I reminded him that he had already given his
consent, he lost his temper. We decided after this distressing
scene to go away, and we left for Heidelberg, our ultimate
objective in any case, the next day.</p>

<p>E. and I had invented a game which I think I enjoyed
more than any game I have ever played at, with the exception
of a good game of Spankaboo. It was called: “The Game.”
You played it like this: One player gave the other player two
lines or more of poetry, or a sentence of prose, in any language.
The other player was allowed two guesses at the authorship of
the quotation, and, if he said it immediately after the second
guess, breathlessly so to speak, a third guess; but there must
not be a second’s pause between the second and the third.
They had to be “double leads.” The third had to come, if
at all, helter-skelter after the second guess. If you guessed
right you got a mark, and if you guessed wrong you got a
nought; the noughts and crosses were entered into a small
book, which went on getting fuller and fuller. They were
added up at the bottom of every page; but as The Game
is eternal, we shall never know who won it, until the Last
Day, and then perhaps there won’t be time. We both
played it well on the whole, although we both had strange
lapses. I never could guess a line out of <i>Lycidas</i> and E.
never could guess a line out of <i>Adonaïs</i>. I attributed one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
day one of the finest lines of Milton to the poet Montgomery,
and E. made an equally absurd mistake, which happened to
have a profound effect on my future, or rather on my future
literary aspirations. We were playing the game in the <i>Biergarten</i>
at Hildesheim. The band was playing the overture
from <i>Tannhäuser</i>. Schoolboys were walking round the garden,
arm in arm, and when they met an acquaintance took off their
hats all together, in time, and by the right, or by the left, as the
case might be, held them at an arm’s length and put them back
stiffly. At many little tables, groups and families were sitting
enjoying the music, drinking beer and eating <i>Butterbrote</i>. I
said to E.: “Who is this by in <i>The Game</i>?” which was the
recognised formula for saying you had begun to play, because
the game began suddenly in the midst of conversation and
circumstance quite remote from it: no matter how inappropriate
or inopportune. The lines I quoted were these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sank in great calm, as dreaming unison</div>
<div class="verse">Of darkness and midsummer sound must die</div>
<div class="verse">Before the daily duty of the Sun.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh,” said E., without any hesitation, “it’s magnificent—Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “it is not by Shakespeare; it is the end of a
sonnet by Maurice Baring, written at Hildesheim in 1892.”</p>

<p>Now I had shown the poem in which these lines occurred
with others to some undergraduates at Cambridge, possibly to
E. himself, and had been told the stuff was deplorable, which no
doubt it was, but this had so damped my spirits that I had
resolved never to try and write verse again. Then came
Nencioni’s praise (who had marked these very lines in blue
pencil), and I partially reconsidered my decision. Now came
this incident, which opened a shut door for me. It was not
that I didn’t know that in this Game one was capable of any
aberrations. It was not that I took myself seriously, but
the mere fact of E. making such a mistake convinced me that
mistakes <i>in my favour</i> were possible. Nencioni might be right
after all. In any case, there was no reason why I should not
try; and two days later I produced a sonnet, which E.
entirely approved of, and which I afterwards published.</p>

<p>It was a great game; it included not only verse and prose,
but sayings of great and small men, and even of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
acquaintances. We were both at our best in guessing things
from books we had never read. I had an unerring ear for Zola’s
prose, which I had then read little of, and E., whose reading
was far wider and deeper than mine, was very hard to baffle
except, as I have already said, by quoting Shelley’s <i>Adonaïs</i>,
which he ended by learning by heart.</p>

<p>At Heidelberg I introduced E. to Professor Ihne. Professor
Ihne, confronted, in the shape of E., with an undergraduate,
or rather with a graduate, who had just taken his
degree, and had won academical distinctions, was in his most
Johnsonian mood, and contradicted him even when he agreed
with him. He asked E. what degree he had taken at Cambridge,
and when E. said: “Palæography,” Ihne, with a smile, said:
“Oh, that’s all nonsense.” The Professor turned the conversation
on to his favourite topic: the superfluity of the
Norman element in the English language; the sad occurrence
of the word pullulate in a <i>Times</i> article was mentioned, and E.
made a spirited defence of the phrase: “Assemble and meet
together,” which he said was a question of rhythm. “Pooh!”
said Ihne, “it’s only association makes you think that.” The
word “to get,” he said, was used to denote too many things.
Poor E. was interpellated, as if he, and he alone, had been
responsible for the shortcomings of the English language.
He used, said Ihne, the word education when he meant
instruction. “One is instructed at school,” he said. He
asked E. for the derivation of the word caterpillar. E. had
no suggestion to offer. Ihne said he derived it from Kater
and to pill, but he had also given καθερπίζω a thought. Then
the talk veered round to literature. “Schiller,” said Ihne,
“is a greater dramatic poet than Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s
tragedies are too painful; <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Othello</i> are unbearable.”
E. said, unwisely, that Schiller’s women were so uninteresting.
Ihne said that that was a thing E. could know
nothing about, as he was not a married man. For his part, and
he had been a married man, Schiller’s characters, and especially
Thekla, were the most beautiful women characters that had
ever been drawn. E. tried to defend Shakespeare, and pointed
out the qualities of Shakespeare’s women. He mentioned
Portia. “No,” said Ihne; “Portia is not a good character,
because she oversteps her duties as counsel and tries to play
the part of a judge.” “I consider Lord Byron,” said Ihne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
“the finest English poet of the century.” E. said Byron had
a great sense of rhythm. “If he had merely a great sense of
rhythm,” said Ihne, “he wouldn’t have been a great poet.” E.,
to propitiate him, said something laudatory about Goethe’s
<i>Faust</i>. Ihne at once said that Schiller was a greater poet than
Goethe, because <i>Faust</i> was a collection of detached scenes, and
Schiller’s plays were complete wholes.</p>

<p>We saw Professor Ihne several times, and what I have
described is typical of all our conversations.</p>

<p>After staying at Heidelberg for about a week I went back
to London, and the routine of Garrick Chambers began once
more.</p>

<p>The time soon came when I had to go up for my first
examination, and before it there was a period of intensive
cramming. I had scores of teachers, and spent
hour after hour taking private lessons in Latin, German, shorthand,
and arithmetic. A great deal of this cramming was quite
unnecessary, as it did not really touch the vital necessities of the
examination. I read a great deal of German; all Mommsen,
a great deal of French, and all Renan; but literary French
and German were not what was needed; long lists of technical
words were far more necessary. The clichés of political leader-writers;
the German for a <i>belligerent</i>, and the French for a
<i>Committee on Supply</i>; an accurate knowledge of where the
manufacturing cities of England were situated, and the solution
of problems about one tap filling a bath half again as quickly
as another emptied it. I spent a great deal of time, but not
enough as it turned out, making lists of obscure technical words.
I learnt the Latin for <i>prize-money</i>, which I was told was a useful
word for “prose,” but unfortunately the word prize-money did
not occur in the Latin translation paper. The word is <i>manubiæ</i>.
I am glad to know it. It is indeed unforgettable.</p>

<p>We were examined orally in French, German, and in Italian.
When I was confronted with the German examiner, the first
thing he asked me was whether I could speak German. I was
foolishly modest and answered: “<i>Ein wenig</i>” (“A little”).
“Very well,” he said, “it will be for another time.” I made
up my mind that next time I went up I would say I spoke German
as well as Bismarck, and wrote it better than Goethe.</p>

<p>I kept my resolution the last time I went up for the examination,
and it was crowned with success.</p>

<p>Here is one of the arithmetic questions from the examination
paper set in 1894:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“What vulgar fraction expresses the ratio of 17½ square
yards to half an acre?” (I am told this is an easy sum.)</p>

<p>Here is a sentence which had to be translated into German
as it was dictated in English:</p>

<p>“Factions are formed upon opinions; which factions become
in effect bodies corporate in the state;—nay, factions
generate opinions in order to become a centre of union, and to
furnish watchwords to parties; and this may make it expedient
for government to forbid things in themselves innocent and
neutral.”</p>

<p>Here is a geography question of the kind I found most
baffling:</p>

<p>“Make a sketch of the country between the Humber and
the Mersey on the south, and the Firth of Forth and Clyde on
the north.”</p>

<p>When I went up for the examination, I think it was in
January 1896, I failed both in geography and arithmetic, and so
had to begin the routine of cramming all over again. All the
next year I rang the changes again on Florence, Hildesheim, and
Scoones. When the examination was over, I went abroad with
Claud Russell, and we went to Paris and Monte Carlo. Lord
Dufferin was Ambassador in Paris, and we dined with him once
or twice.</p>

<p>We saw Guitry and Jeanne Granier perform Maurice
Donnay’s exquisite play, <i>Amants</i>.</p>

<p>At Monte Carlo we stayed with Sir Edward Mallet in his
“Villa White.” A brother of Lord Salisbury, Lord Sackville
Cecil, was staying there. He had a passion for mechanics;
we had only to say that the sink seemed to be gurgling, or
the window rattling, or the door creaking, and in a moment
he would have his coat off, and, screwdriver in hand, would set
to work plumbing, glazing, or joining.</p>

<p>One night after dinner, just to see what would happen, I said
the pedal of the pianoforte seemed to wheeze. In a second he
was under the pianoforte and soon had it in pieces. He found
many things radically wrong, and he was grateful to me for
having given him the opportunity of setting them right. Sir
Edward Mallet had retired from the Diplomatic Service. The
house where we stayed, and which he had designed himself,
was a curious example of design and decoration. It was designed
in the German Rococo style, and in the large hall stucco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pillars had for capitals, florid, gilded, coloured, and luxuriant
moulded festoons which represented flames, and soared into
the ceiling.</p>

<p>One afternoon Lord Sackville Cecil said he wanted to see
the gambling-rooms. We went for a walk, and on our way
back stopped at the rooms. Lord Sackville Cecil was not an
elegant dresser; his enormous boots after our walk were covered
with dust, and his appearance was so untidy that the attendant
refused to let him in. I suggested his showing a card, but his
spirit rebelled at such a climb-down, and we went home without
seeing the rooms.</p>

<p>From Monte Carlo I went to Florence. I went back to my
pension but also stayed for over a week with Vernon Lee at her
villa. Her brother, Eugene Lee-Hamilton, who had been on
his back a helpless invalid for over twenty years, had suddenly,
in a marvellous manner, recovered, and his first act had been
to climb up Mount Vesuvius.</p>

<p>I recollect the great beauty and the heat of that month of
March at Florence. Giotto’s Tower, and the graceful dome of
the Cathedral, seen from the plain at the foot of San Gervasio,
looked more like flowers than like buildings in the March
evenings, across vistas of early green foliage and the delicate
pageant of blossom.</p>

<p>We went for many delightful expeditions: to a farmhouse
that had belonged to Michael Angelo at Carregi; to the Villa
Gamberaia with its long grass terrace and its tall cypresses—a
place that belongs to a fairy-tale; and I remember more
vividly than all a wine-press in a village with wine-stained vats,
large barrels, and a litter of farm instruments under the sun-baked
walls—a place that at once conjured up visions of southern
ripeness and mellowness. It seemed to embody the dreams
of Keats and Chénier, and took me once more to the imaginary
Italy which I had built when I read in the <i>Lays of Ancient
Rome</i> of “the vats of Luna” and “the harvests of Arretium.”</p>

<p>Then came a summer term at Scoones, distracted and
dislocated by many amusements. I went to the Derby that
year and backed Persimmon; to the first performance of
Mrs. Campbell’s <i>Magda</i> the same night; I saw Duse at Drury
Lane and Sarah Bernhardt at Daly’s; I went to Ascot; I
went to balls; I stayed at Panshanger; and at Wrest, at
the end of the summer, where a constellation of beauty moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in muslin and straw hats and yellow roses on the lawns of
gardens designed by Lenôtre, delicious with ripe peaches on old
brick walls, with the smell of verbena, and sweet geranium;
and stately with large avenues, artificial lakes and white
temples; and we bicycled in the warm night past ghostly
cornfields by the light of a large full moon.</p>

<p>In August I went back to Germany, and heard the <i>Ring</i>
at Bayreuth. Mottl conducted. But of all that sound and
fury, the only thing that remains in my mind is a French lady
who sat next to me, and who, when Siegfried’s body was carried
by to the strains of the tremendous funeral march, burst into
sobs, and said to me: “Moi aussi j’ai un fils, Monsieur.” Then
in London I made a terrific spurt, and worked all day and far
into the night to make ready for another examination which
took place on November 14. I remember nothing of this
long nightmare. As soon as the examination was over, I
started with Claud Russell for Egypt. We went by train to
Marseilles, and then embarked in a Messagerie steamer. I
spent the time reading Tolstoy’s <i>War and Peace</i> for the first
time. The passengers were nearly all French, and treated us
with some disdain; but Fate avenged us, for when we arrived
at Alexandria, we were, in obedience to the orders of my uncle
(Lord Cromer), allowed to proceed at once, while the rest of the
passengers had to wait in quarantine. We went to Cairo,
and stayed at the Agency with my uncle. The day we arrived
it was pouring with rain which, we were told, was a rare occurrence
in Cairo.</p>

<p>We used to have breakfast on a high verandah outside our
bedrooms, off tiny little eggs and equally small fresh bananas.</p>

<p>At luncheon the whole of the diplomatic staff used to be
present, and usually guests as well. The news came to Cairo
that I had failed to pass the examination, in geography and
arithmetic. Claud Russell, I think, qualified, and was given
a vacancy later.</p>

<p>In the evening my uncle used sometimes to read us passages
of abuse about himself in the local press. One phrase which
described him as combining the oiliness of a Chadband with
the malignity of a fiend delighted him. He gave us the MSS.
of his book, <i>Modern Egypt</i>, which was then only partly written,
to read. He was never tired of discussing books: the Classics,
French novels, the English poets of the eighteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
He could not endure the verse of Robert Browning. His
admiration for French prose was unbounded and for the French
gift of expression in general, their newspaper articles, their
speeches, and, above all, their acting.</p>

<p>Sometimes we rode to the Pyramids, and one day we had
tea with Wilfrid and Lady Anne Blunt in their Arab house.</p>

<p>We did not stay long in Cairo; we went up the Nile. The
first part of the journey, to a station whose name I forget, was
by train; and once, when the train stopped in the desert, the
engine-driver brought Claud Russell a copybook and asked him
to correct an English exercise he had just done. Claud said
how odd we should think it if in England the engine-driver
brought us an exercise to correct.</p>

<p>Then we embarked in the M.S. <i>Cleopatra</i> and steamed to
Luxor, where we saw the sights: the tombs of the kings, the
temple of Carnac, the statue of Memnon. We bathed in the
Nile, and smoked hashish.</p>

<p>We were back in Europe by Christmas, and spent Christmas
night in the waiting-room of Turin railway station playing chess;
and when we arrived in London the momentous question arose,
what was I to do to pass the examination? We were only
allowed three tries, and my next attempt would be my last chance.</p>

<p>The large staff of teachers who were cramming me were in
despair. I was told I must pass the next time.</p>

<p>The trouble was that the standard of arithmetic demanded
by this examination was an elementary standard, and I had now
twice attained by cramming a pitch I knew I should never
surpass. At Scoones’ they said my only chance lay in getting
an easy paper. It was said that my work had been wrong not
in degree but in kind. I had merely wasted time by reading
Renan and Mommsen; other candidates, who had never read
a German book in their lives, by learning lists of words got
more marks than I did. Herr Dittel, who gave me private
lessons in German, said that he could have sent a German essay
of mine to a German magazine. But not knowing the German
for “belligerent,” I was beaten by others who knew the language
less well. The same applied to the French in which I was only
second, although perhaps in some ways the best French scholar
among the candidates.</p>

<p>It seemed useless for me to go back to Scoones’ and useless
to go abroad. After much debate and discussion the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was settled by chance. I made the acquaintance of Auberon
Herbert in the winter, and instead of going to a crammer’s I
settled to go and live at Oxford, and I took rooms at King
Edward Street and went to coaches in Latin and arithmetic.
For two terms I lived exactly as an undergraduate, and there
was no difference between my life and that of a member of
Balliol except that I was not subject to College authority.</p>

<p>Then began an interlude of perfect happiness. I did a
little work but felt no need of doing any more, as, if anything,
I had been overcrammed and was simply in need of digestion.
I rediscovered English literature with Bron, and shared in his
College life and in the lives of others. Life was a long series
of small dramas. One night Bron pulled the master’s bath-chair
round the Quad, and the matter was taken with the
utmost seriousness by the College authorities. A College meeting
was held, and Bron was nearly sent down. Old Balliol men
would come from London and stay the night: Claud Russell
and Antony Henley. Arnold Ward was engrossed in Turgenev;
Cubby Medd,—or was that later?—who gave promise
of great brilliance, was spellbound by Rossetti. And then
there were the long, the endlessly long, serious conversations
about the events of the College life and athletics and the
Toggers and the Anna and the Devor. It was like being at
Eton again. Indeed, I never could see any difference between
Eton and Balliol. Balliol seemed to me an older edition of
Eton, whereas Cambridge was to me a slightly different world,
different in kind, although in many ways like Oxford; and,
although neither of them know it, and each would deny it
vehemently, they are startlingly like each other all the same.</p>

<p>I knew undergraduates at other Colleges as well as at
Balliol and a certain number of the Dons as well.</p>

<p>I also knew a good many of the old Balliol men who used to
come down to Oxford and sometimes stay in King Edward Street.</p>

<p>Then came the summer term. We had a punt, and Bron
Herbert, myself, and others would go out in it and read aloud
Wells’ <i>Plattner Story</i> and sometimes <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and
sometimes from a volume of Swinburne bound in green shagreen—an
American edition which contained “Atalanta in Calydon”
and the “Poems and Ballads.” That summer I made friends
with Hilary Belloc, who lived at Oxford in Holywell and was
coaching young pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>I had met him once before with Basil Blackwood, but all he
had said to me was that I would most certainly go to hell, and
so I had not thought it likely that we should ever make friends,
although I recognised the first moment I saw him that he was
a remarkable man.</p>

<p>He had a charming little house in Holywell, and there he
and Antony Henley used to discuss all manner of things.</p>

<p>I had written by now a number of Sonnets, and Belloc
approved of them. One of them he copied out and hung up
in his room on the back of a picture. I showed him too the
draft of some parodies written in French of some French authors.
He approved of these also, and used to translate them to his
pupils, and make them translate them back into French.</p>

<p>Belloc was writing a book about Danton, and from time
to time he would make up rhymes which afterwards became
the <i>Bad Child’s Book of Beasts</i>. The year before I went to
Oxford he had published a small book of verse on hard paper
called <i>Verses and Sonnets</i>, which contained among several
beautiful poems a poem called “Auvergnat.” I do not think
that this book excited a ripple of attention at the time, and
yet some of the poems in it have lived, and are now found in
many anthologies, whereas the verse which at this time was
received with a clamour of applause is nearly all of it not only
dead but buried and completely forgotten.</p>

<p>We had wonderful supper-parties in King Edward Street.
Donald Tovey, who was then musical scholar at Balliol, used to
come and play a Wagnerian setting to a story he had found in
<i>Punch</i> called the “Hornets,” and sometimes the Waldstein
Sonata. He discussed music boldly with Fletcher, the Rowing
Blue. Belloc discoursed of the Jewish Peril, the Catholic
Church, the “Chanson de Roland,” Ronsard, and the Pyrenees
with indescribable gusto and vehemence.</p>

<p>People would come in through the window, and syphons
would sometimes be hurled across the room; but nobody was
ever wounded. The ham would be slapped and butter thrown
to the ceiling, where it stuck. Piles of chairs would be placed
in a pinnacle, one on the top of the other, over Arthur Stanley,
and someone would climb to the top of this airy Babel and drop
ink down on him through the seats of the chairs. Songs were
sung; port was drunk and thrown about the room. Indeed
we had a special brand of port, which was called <i>throwing port</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
for the purpose. And then again the evenings would finish in
long talks, the endless serious talks of youth, ranging over every
topic from Transubstantiation to Toggers, and from the last
row with the Junior Dean to Predestination and Free-will.
We were all discovering things for each other and opening for
each other unguessed-of doors.</p>

<p>Donald Tovey used to explain to us how bad, musically,
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> were, and tried (and failed) to explain
me the Chinese scale; Belloc would quote the “Chanson de
Roland” and, when shown some piece of verse in French or
English that he liked, would say: “Why have I not known that
before?” or murmur: “Good verse. Good verse.” Antony
Henley used to quote Shakespeare’s lines from <i>Henry V.</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We would not die in that man’s company</div>
<div class="verse">Who fears his fellowship to die with us,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as the most satisfying lines in the language. And I would
punctuate the long discussions by playing over and over again
at the pianoforte a German students’ song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Es hatten drei Gesellen ein fein Collegium,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and sometimes translate Heine’s songs to Belloc.</p>

<p>Best of all were the long summer afternoons and evenings
on the river, when the punt drifted in tangled backwaters, and
improvised bathes and unexpected dives took place, and a hazy
film of inconsequent conversation and idle argument was spun
by the half-sleeping inmates of the wandering, lazy punt.</p>

<p>During the Easter holidays I went back to Hildesheim for
the last time as a pupil. Sometimes when I was supposed to
be working, Frau Timme would find me engaged in a literary
pursuit, and she would say: “<i>Ach, Herr Baring, lassen Sie diese
Schriftstellerei und machen Sie Ihr Examen</i>” (“Leave all that
writing business and pass your examination”).</p>

<p>Before saying a final good-bye to Hildesheim, I will try to
sum up what chiefly struck me in the five years during which
I visited Germany constantly. Nearly all the Germans I
met, with few exceptions, belonged to the bourgeois, the professional
class, the <i>intelligentsia</i>; and they used to speak their
mind on politics in general and on English politics in particular
with frankness and freedom.</p>

<p>I believe that during all this period our relations with Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were supposed to be good. Lord Salisbury was directing
the foreign policy of England, and his object was to maintain
the balance of power in Europe: friendly relations with both
Germany and France, without entangling England in any
foreign complications.</p>

<p>The English then, as Bismarck said, were bad Europeans.
It would have perhaps been better for England if it had been
possible for them to continue to be so.</p>

<p>But the Germans I saw never thought that the relations
between the two countries were satisfactory, and they laid
the whole blame on England. I never once met a German
who said it would be a good thing for Germany and England
to be friends, with the exception of Professor Ihne. But I
constantly met Germans who said Germany might be friends
with England but England made it impossible. England, they
said, was the spoil-sport of Germany. I was at Hildesheim
when the cession of Heligoland to Germany was announced.
“<i>England</i>,” said the Germans, “<i>ist sehr schlau</i>” (“The
English are very sly”). They thought they had made a bad
bargain.</p>

<p>So even, when they had gained an advantage, it escaped their
notice; and they always thought they had been cheated and
bamboozled. What opened my eyes more clearly still was the
instruction given to the schoolboys; the history lessons during
which no opportunity was ever lost of belittling England,
and above all the history books, the <i>Weltgeschichten</i> (World-histories),
which the boys used to read for pleasure.</p>

<p>In these histories of the world, the part that England played
in mundane affairs was made to appear either insignificant,
baleful, or mean. England was hardly mentioned during the
earlier periods of history. There was hardly anything about
the England of the Tudors, or the Stuarts, but England’s rôle
in the Napoleonic Wars, in which England was the ally of Germany,
was made to appear that of a dishonest broker, a clever
monkey making the foolish cats pull the chestnuts out of the
fire. The whole of England’s success was attributed to money
and money-making. “<i>Sie haben</i>,” the Timmes used constantly
to say, “<i>den grossen Geldbeutel</i>” (“You have the
large purse”). It was not only the Timmes who used to rub
this in, in season and out of season, but casual strangers one
met in the train or drinking beer at a restaurant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>My impression was that Germans of this class detested
England as a nation, in a manner which Englishmen did not
suspect.</p>

<p>“<i>Die Engländer sind nicht mutig aber prahlen können Sie</i>”
(“The English are not brave, but they know how to boast”),
a boy once said to me.</p>

<p>They constantly used to lay down the law about English
matters and conditions of life in England which they knew
nothing of at all. In England, they used to say, people do
such and such a thing. The English have no this or no that.
Above all, “<i>Kein Bier</i>,” and when I said there was such a thing
as beer in England, they used to answer: “<i>Ach, das Pale-Ale,
aber kein Bierkomment</i>,” which was indeed true.</p>

<p>During the time I spent in Hildesheim you could have
heard every single grievance that was used as propaganda in
neutral countries during the European War, and when I was
in Italy during the war, Italians expressed opinions to me
which were obviously German in inspiration and were echoes
of what I used to hear in Hildesheim.</p>

<p>I never met a German who had been to England, but they
always had the most clearly defined and positive views of
every branch of English life. When I was at school at Hildesheim,
the book the boys used to read to teach them English
was a book about social conditions and domestic life in England,
described by a German who, I suppose, had been to England.
He had a singular gift for misunderstanding the simplest and
most ordinary occurrences and phenomena of English life and
the English character.</p>

<p>I suppose it would be true to say that the English did not
know the Germans any better than the Germans knew them.
English statesmen, with one exception, certainly knew little
of Germany, but there is this difference. The English admitted
their ignorance, their indifference, and passed on. They never
theorised about the Germans, nor dogmatised. They never
said: “There is no cheese in Germany,” or: “The Germans
cannot play football.” They did not know whether they did
or not, and cared still less.</p>

<p>During the Boer War, the German Press voiced with virulence
all that the middle class in Germany had thought for years,
and we were astonished at this explosion of violence; but
in reality this was no new phenomenon; it was the natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
expression of feelings that had existed for long and which
now found a favourable outlet.</p>

<p>Of course, in the upper classes, things, for all I know, may
have been quite different. I know that there were influential
Germans who always wished for good relations between the
two countries, but even there they were in a minority.</p>

<p>I left Germany grateful for many things, extremely fond of
many of the people I had known, but convinced that there was
not the slightest chance of popular opinion in Germany ever
being favourable towards England, as the feeling the Germans
harboured was one of envy—the envy a clever person feels for
someone he knows to be more stupid than himself yet to be
far more successful, and who succeeds without apparent effort,
where he has laboriously tried and failed.</p>

<p>Bismarck used to say there was not a German who would
not be proud to be taken for an Englishman, and when Germans
felt this to be true it only made them the more angry.</p>

<p>Years later I heard foreign diplomatists who knew Germany
well sometimes say that the English alarm and suspicion of
German hatred of England was baseless, and that the idea that
Germany was always brooding on a possible war with England
was unfounded.</p>

<p>When asked how they accounted for the evidence which
daily seemed to point to the contrary, they would say they
knew some German politicians intimately who desired nothing
so much as good relations with England. This was no doubt
true, but in speaking like this, these impartial foreigners were
thinking of certain highly cultured, liberal-minded aristocrats.
They did not know the German bourgeoisie. Indeed they
often said, when someone alluded to the violence of German
newspapers: “That’s the Professors.”</p>

<p>It was the Professors. But it was the Professors who wrote
the history books, who taught the children and the schoolboys,
lectured to the students, and trained the minds of the future
politicians and soldiers of Germany.</p>

<p>During my last sojourn at Hildesheim I went to stay with
Erich Wippern, who was learning forestry in the Harz Mountains.
He lived in a little wooden house in the forest. The house was
furnished entirely with antlers, and from morning till night, he
associated with trees and was taught all about them by an old
forester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>I never went back to Hildesheim again for any time,
although I used sometimes to stay a night there on my
way to or from Russia. The last time I heard of the
Timmes was just before the outbreak of war, when I
received a letter from Kurt Timme, whom I had known
twenty-two years before as a little boy, telling me his
father was dead, and inviting me to attend his own wedding.
Kurt was an officer, now a lieutenant. I sent him
a wedding present. Two weeks later we were at war with
Germany.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer term, Bron, Kershaw, and myself
gave a dinner-party at the Mitre, to which forty guests were
invited. Slap’s band officiated. The banquet took place in a
room upstairs. This was the menu:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">JUNE 16, 1897.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Melon, Two Soups, Salmon, Whitebait, Sweetbread,<br />
Bits of Chicken, Lamb, Potatoes, Asparagus,<br />
Duck, Peas, Salad, Jelly, Ice, Strawberries,<br />
Round Things.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The caterers of the dinner were loth to print such a menu.</p>

<p>They hankered for phrases such as <i>Purée à la bonne femme</i>,
and <i>Poulets printaniers</i>, but I overruled them. Very soon,
during dinner, the musical instruments were smashed to bits,
and towards the end of the meal there was a fine ice-throwing
competition. After dinner the guests adjourned to Balliol
Quadrangle.</p>

<p>It was Jubilee year—the second Jubilee. Preparations
were being made in London for the procession and for other
festivities, and the atmosphere was charged with triumph and
prosperity. For the third time in my life I saw Queen Victoria
drive through the streets of London. I saw the procession from
Montagu House in Whitehall. This was the most imposing of
all the pageants, and the most striking thing about it was perhaps
the crowd.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of talk about the Fancy Dress Ball
at Devonshire House. I had a complicated costume for it, but
none of my family went to it as our Uncle Johnny died just
before it came off. We went to see some of the people in their
clothes at Lord Cowper’s house in St. James’s Square, where I
remember a tall and blindingly beautiful Hebe, a dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Charlotte Corday, in grey and vermilion, a lady who looked as
if she had stepped out of an Italian picture, with a long, faded
Venetian red train and a silver hat tapering into a point, and
another who had stepped from an old English frame, a pale
figure in faded draperies and exquisite lace, with a cluster of
historic and curiously set jewels in her hair, and arms and
shoulders like those of a sculpture of the finest Greek period.</p>

<p>Later on in the summer, my father, who had not been
well for some time, died, and we said good-bye to 37 Charles
Street, and to Membland after the funeral was over, for ever.</p>

<p>I went to a crammer’s at Bournemouth and spent the
whole of the winter in London being intensively crammed, and
all through the Christmas holidays. In the spring there was
a further examination.</p>

<p>This time I qualified in all subjects, and I was given half-marks
in arithmetic. The gift of these half-marks must have
been a favour, as, comparing my answers with those of other
candidates, after the examination, I found that my answers
in no way coincided with theirs.</p>

<p>Years later I met a M. Roche, who had been the French
examiner. He told me that I was not going to be let through;
(as I suspected, I had not passed in arithmetic), but that he had
gone to the Board of Examiners and had told them the French
essay I had written might have been written by a Frenchman.
When the result of the examination was announced I was not in
the first three, but when the first vacancy occurred later, I was
given it, and on 20th June 1898 I received a letter from the
Civil Service Commission saying that, owing to an additional
vacancy having been reported, I had been placed in the
position of a successful candidate, and asking me to furnish
evidence of my age.</p>

<p>I was able to do this, and was admitted into the Foreign
Office and placed in the African Department.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my first summer at the Foreign Office before
the newness of the work and surroundings wore off. The
African Department was interesting. It has since been taken
over by the Colonial Office. Officials from West Africa
would drift in and tell us interesting things, and there was
in the Department a senior clerk whose devotion to office
work was such that his leave, on the rare occasions he took
it, used to consist in his coming down to the office at eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in the morning instead of at ten. At the end of the summer I
was moved up into the Commercial Department, which was a
haven of rest in the Foreign Office, as no registering had to be
done there, and no putting away of papers; and the junior
clerks used to write drafts on commercial matters—tenders
and automatic couplings. In the other departments they had
to serve a fifteen-year apprenticeship before being allowed to
write a draft.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in that autumn, the whole life of the Office was
made exciting by the Fashoda crisis. We were actually on the
brink of a European war. The question which used to be discussed
from morning till night in the Office was: “Will Lord
Salisbury climb down?” The Office thought we always climbed
down; that Lord Salisbury was the King of Climbers-down.
But Lord Salisbury had no intention of climbing down this
time, and did not do so. I remember my Uncle Cromer saying
one day, when someone attacked what he called Lord Salisbury’s
vacillating and weak policy: “Lord Salisbury knows his
Europe; he has an eye on what is going on in all the countries
and on our interests all over the world, and not only on one
small part of the world.” During this crisis, the tension
between France and England was extreme; it was made worse
by the inflammatory speeches that irresponsible members of
Parliament made all over England at the time. I believe
they shared the Foreign Office view that Lord Salisbury would
climb down at the end, and were trying to burn his boats for
him; but they need not have troubled, and their speeches did
far more harm than good. They had no effect on the policy
of the Foreign Office, which was clearly settled in Lord
Salisbury’s mind; all they did was to exasperate the French,
and to make matters more difficult for the Government.
This was the first experience of what seems to me to recur
whenever England is in difficulties. Directly a crisis arises
in which England is involved, dozens of irresponsible people,
and sometimes even responsible people, set about to make
matters far more difficult than they need be. This was especially
true during the European War. I never saw Lord Salisbury
in person during the time I spent in the Foreign Office,
except at a garden-party at Hatfield, where I was one of several
hundreds whom he shook hands with. But I had often the
opportunity of reading his minutes, and sometimes his reports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
written in his own handwriting, of conversations he had held
with Foreign Ambassadors. These were always amusing and
caustic, and his comments were wise and far sighted.</p>

<p>The internal arrangements and organisation of the Office
were in the hands of Lord Sanderson. Many of the clerks
lived in terror of him. He was extremely kind to me, although
he always told me I should never be a good clerk and would
do better to stick to diplomacy. Even on the printed forms
we used to fill up, enclosing communications, which we called
P.L.’s, and which he used to sign himself, in person, every
evening, a clerk standing beside him with a slip of blotting-paper,
his minute eye for detail used constantly to discern a slight
inaccuracy, either in the mode of address or the terminology.
He would then take a scraper and scratch it out and amend it.
The signing of all these forms must have used a great deal of
his time, and I believe the custom has now been abolished.</p>

<p>In those days all dispatches were kept folded in the Office,
an immensely inconvenient practice. All the other public
offices kept them flat, but when it was suggested that the
Foreign Office papers should be kept flat, there was a storm of
opposition. They had been kept folded for a hundred years;
the change was unthinkable. Someone suggested a compromise:
that they should be half-folded and kept curved, but this was
abandoned. Ultimately, I believe, they were allowed to be
kept flat.</p>

<p>Later on, the whole work of the Foreign Office was reformed,
and the clerks no longer have to spend half the day
in doing manual clerical work. In my time it was most exhausting,
except in the Commercial Department, which was
a haven of gentlemanlike ease. Telegrams had often to be
ciphered and deciphered by the clerk, but not often in the
Commercial Department. But on one Saturday afternoon
I remember having to send off two telegrams, one to Sweden
and one to Constantinople, and I sent the Swedish telegram
to Constantinople and the Turkish telegram to Sweden, and
nothing could be done to remedy the mistake till Monday, as
nobody noticed it till it was too late, and the clerks went away
on Saturday afternoon. Sending off the bags was always a
moment of fuss, anxiety, and strain. Someone nearly always
out of excitement used to drop the sealing-wax on the hand
of the clerk who was holding the bag, and sometimes the bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
used to be sent to the wrong place. One day both Lord Sanderson
and Sir Frank Bertie came into one of the departments
to make sure the bag should go to the right place. The
excess of cooks had a fatal result on the broth, and the bag,
which was destined for some not remote spot, was sent to
Guatemala by mistake, whence it could not be retrieved for
several months.</p>

<p>After Christmas that year I stayed with the Cornishes at the
Cloisters at Eton, and we acted a play called <i>Sylvie and Bruno</i>,
adapted from Lewis Carroll’s book. The Cornish children and
the Ritchies took part in it. I played the part of the Other
Professor, and one act was taken up by his giving a lecture.
The play was successful, and Donald Tovey wrote some music
for it and accompanied the singers at the pianoforte.</p>

<p>In January I was appointed attache to the Embassy at
Paris, and I began my career as a diplomat.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">PARIS</span></h2>

<p>I had rooms at the Embassy, a bedroom above the
Chancery, and a little sitting-room on the same floor
as the Chancery. The Ambassador was Sir Edmund
Monson; the Councillor, Michael Herbert; the head of the
Chancery, Reggie Lister. Both of these had rooms to themselves
where they worked. The other secretaries worked in
the Chancery.</p>

<p>In the morning, the bag used to arrive from the Foreign
Office. It used to be fetched from Calais every night, and twice
a week a King’s Messenger would bring it. The business of
the day began by the bag being opened, and the contents were
entered in a register and then sent to the Ambassador. The
dispatches were then sent back to the Chancery in red
boxes to be dealt with, and were finally folded up and put
away in a cupboard. Later on in the day, a box used
to come down from the Ambassador with draft dispatches,
which were written out by us on typewriters, if we could, or
with a pen.</p>

<p>Work at the Embassy meant writing out dispatches on a
typewriter, registering dispatches and putting them away, or
ciphering and deciphering telegrams. That was the important
part of the work. It was for that one had to hang about in case
it might happen, and it was liable to happen at any moment of
the day, or the night.</p>

<p>Besides this, there was a perpetual stream of minor occurrences
which came into the day’s work. People of all nationalities
used to call at the Embassy and have to be interviewed
by someone. A lady would arrive and say she would like to
paint a miniature of Queen Victoria; a soldier would arrive
from India who thought he had been bitten by a mad dog, and
ask to see Pasteur; a man would call who was the only legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
King of France, Henry <span class="smcapuc">V.</span>, with his title and dynasty printed
on his visiting card, and ask for the intervention of the British
Government; or someone would come to say that he had
found the real solution of the Irish problem, or the Eastern
question; or a way of introducing conscription into England
without incurring any expense and without English people
being aware of it. Besides this, British subjects of every kind
would come and ask for facilities to see Museums, to write
books, to learn how to cure snake bites, to paddle in canoes on
the Oise or the Loire, to take their pet dogs back to England
without muzzles (this was always refused), or to take a book
from the Bibliothèque Nationale, or a missal from some remote
Museum. All these people had to be interviewed and their
requests, if reasonable, had to be forwarded to the French
Government, for which there were special stereotyped formulæ.
Drafts had to be written for notes to the French Government,
and there was a large correspondence with the various
Consulates.</p>

<p>In the morning, the head of the Chancery used to interview
the Ambassador and report to the Chancery on the state of his
temper; sometimes he would go and see a French Minister
and come back laden with news and gossip; various secretaries,
the naval and military attachés, or the King’s Messenger,
would stroll into the Chancery, and discuss the latest news,
and sometimes other visitors from England would waste our
time.</p>

<p>The Ambassador never appeared in person in the Chancery,
and his displeasure with the staff, when it was incurred, used
to be conveyed to them in memoranda, written in red ink, which
were sent to them in a red leather dispatch box.</p>

<p>Sir Edmund Monson had the pen of a ready dispatch-writer,
and he would write very long and beautifully expressed
dispatches.</p>

<p>We used to have luncheon generally at the same restaurant,
and be free in the afternoons, although we had to come back
towards tea-time to see if there was anything to do and often
remain in the Chancery till nearly eight o’clock; one resident
clerk had to live in the house in case there were telegrams at
night. If there was a lot of telegraphing, the work would be
heavy.</p>

<p>The Chancery hours were always gay. One day one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
third secretaries and myself had an argument, and I threw the
contents of the inkpot at him. He threw the contents of
another inkpot back at me. The interchange of ink then
became intensive, and went as far as red ink. All the inkpots
of the Chancery were emptied, and the other secretaries ducked
their heads while the grenades of ink whizzed past their heads.
The fight went on till all the ink in the Chancery was used up.
My sitting-room was then drawn on, and the fight went on
down the Chancery stairs, into the street, and I had a final
shot from my sitting-room window, the ink pouring down the
walls.</p>

<p>We were drenched with ink, red and black, but still more
so was the Chancery carpet, the staircase, and the walls of
the Rue Faubourg St. Honoré. Reggie Lister was told
what had happened, and said: “Really, those boys are too
tiresome.”</p>

<p>We were alarmed at the state of the carpet, a handsome red
densely thick pile. We bought some chemicals from the
chemist and tried to wash it out, spending hours in the
effort after dinner. The only result was that the corrosive
acids burnt the carpet away, which made the damage much
worse.</p>

<p>The next morning Herbert arrived at the Embassy and
noticed that the Chancery staircase was splashed with black
stains. He asked the reason and was told. We were sent for.
In quiet, acid, biting tones he told us we were nothing better
than dirty little schoolboys, and we went away with our tails
between our legs. But all that was nothing; Reggie’s plaintive
remonstration and Herbert’s biting censure left us calm; what
we were really frightened of was the Ambassador—would he
find it out?</p>

<p>The next three days were days of dark apprehension, overclouded
with the shadow of a possible ink-row; especially as
the stain caused by the acids on the Chancery carpet had turned
it grey and white, and left a dreadful cavity in the middle of the
stain. We ordered a new carpet and prayed that the Ambassador
might not be led by an evil mischance to visit the
Chancery. He did not, and the episode passed off unnoticed
by him.</p>

<p>Our relations with France at this time were not of the best.
The Fashoda incident was just over; the Boer War was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on, which the French said was: “Une guerre d’affaires”; a
speech had been made recently by Sir E. Monson at the banquet
of the Chamber of Commerce which had made a great sensation.
The majority of the French Cabinet were in favour of
asking that the British Government be asked to recall Sir E.
Monson, but M. Delcassé was strongly opposed to this as he
feared war. In spite of all this, the French were friendly to
us personally. I was elected to the “Cercle de l’Union” and
seconded by General Galliffet.</p>

<p>The French were absorbed in the Dreyfus case. Nothing
else was discussed from morning till night. Wherever one
went one heard echoes of this discussion, and in whatever circle
or group you heard the problem discussed the disputants were
generally divided in a proportion of five to three; three believing
in the innocence of Dreyfus, and five believing in his
guilt.</p>

<p>One night I dined with Edouard Rod and Brewster. The
burning topic engrossed us to such an extent, we discussed it so
long and so keenly that I still remember the only other subjects
we mentioned; they stood out, isolated and rare, like oases
in the vast Dreyfus desert. I remember Rod saying he didn’t
care for Verlaine’s poetry, because it wasn’t <i>banal</i> enough.
Brewster and I quoted some lines; but Rod thought them all
too subtle and not direct enough. Finally I quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Triste, triste était mon âme,</div>
<div class="verse">A cause, à cause d’une femme.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This he passed.</p>

<p>We discussed plays for a brief moment. Rod said he
liked bad plays played by good actors—for instance, Duse in
<i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>; Brewster said he liked good plays
done by bad actors—Musset played by refined amateurs; I
said I liked good plays acted by good actors. Then we talked
of Dreyfus once more, and Rod said plaintively: “De quoi est-ce-qu’on
parlera lorsque l’affaire sera finie?”</p>

<p>I made acquaintance of Anatole France and attended some
of his Sunday morning levées at the Villa Said in the Bois de
Boulogne.</p>

<p>When I first went there, I never heard any topic except
<i>L’affaire</i> mentioned, and indeed the only people present at
these meetings were fanatical partisans of Dreyfus who did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
wish to talk of anything else. In other houses I met equally
fanatical believers in Dreyfus’ guilt. While one was sitting
at a quiet tea, an excited academician would rush in and say:
“Savez-vous ce qu’ils ont fait? Savez-vous ce qu’ils osent
dire?” I find this entry in my notebook dated 5th July 1899,
from Boswell:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Talking of a court-martial that was sitting upon a very
momentous public occasion, he (Dr. Johnson) expressed much
doubt of an enlightened decision; and said that perhaps there
was not a member of it who in the whole course of his life had
ever spent an hour by himself in balancing probabilities.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, I remember someone saying at the time
that although the decisions of court-martials were nearly
always wrong, technically, in their form, they were nearly
always right in substance.</p>

<p>Most English people whom I saw during this period believed
in Dreyfus’ innocence, but not all. Among the fervent believers
in his guilt was Arthur Strong, then librarian in the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>I had made Arthur Strong’s acquaintance at Edmund
Gosse’s house, and he was from that moment kind to me.
In appearance he was like pictures of Erasmus (not that I
have ever seen one!)—the perfect incarnation of a scholar. He
knew and understood everything, but forgave little. And the
smoke from the flame of his learning and his intellect sometimes
got into people’s eyes. I frequently saw him in London,
and once he came to see me in Paris. I remember his looking
at the bookshelf and the pictures on my walls, photographs of
pictures by Giorgione and Titian.</p>

<p>He approved of Dyce’s Shakespeare; Dyce’s, he said, was
a good edition. He disapproved of Stevenson; Stevenson, he
said, had fancy but no imagination. Giorgione, he said, was to
Titian what Marcello was to Gluck. Talking of the Dreyfus
case, he said if English people would only understand that the
Dreyfusards are the same as pro-Boers in England they would
talk differently. He said the French were supreme critics of
verse. They were like the Persians, they stood no nonsense
about poetry. To them it was either good or bad verse.
He used to say that there had never been since Johnson’s
<i>Lives of the Poets</i> a critical review of English literature as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
big and as broad. We might find fault with some of
Dr. Johnson’s judgments, but there had been nothing to
replace it.</p>

<p>He admired Byron as much as my father did, and in the
same way. He thought him a towering genius. Shelley likewise,
but not Wordsworth. Wordsworth, he said, was like
Taine and Wagner. They were all three just on the wrong
lines, each one of them on a tremendous scale, but wrong
nevertheless.</p>

<p>We used to have fierce arguments about Wagner. Wagner’s
work, he used to say, was not dramatic but scenic. He invented
a vastly effective situation but left it at that; neither
the action nor the music moved on. He thought Mozart was
infinitely more dramatic. He said that Wagner could not
write a melody, and that if he did, with the exception of the
Preislied in the <i>Meistersinger</i>, it was commonplace and vulgar.
The “Leit-Motivs” were not complete melodies.</p>

<p>I was at that time a fervent Wagnerite, and used to contest
his points hotly. Curiously enough, six years later, his ideas
on Wagner found an echo in a letter which I received from
Vernon Lee, after she had been to Bayreuth. This is what
she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About Bayreuth. Although I expected little enjoyment,
I have been miserably disappointed. It is so much less out
of the common than I expected. Just a theatre like any other,
save for the light being turned out entirely instead of half-cock
only, and the only beautiful things an opera ever offers to the
eye, namely the fiddles, great and small, and the enchanting
kettle-drums, being stuffed out of sight. The <i>mise en scène</i> is
more grotesquely bad than almost any other opera get-up.
What is insufferable to me is the atrocious way in which Wagner
takes himself seriously: the self-complacent (if I may coin an
absurd expression) <i>auto-religion</i> implied in his hateful unbridled
long-windedness and reiteration; the element of degenerate
priesthood in it all, like English people contemplating their
hat linings in Church, their prudery about the name of God… Surely
all great art of every sort has a certain coyness which
makes it give itself always less than wanted: look at Mozart,
he will give you a whole act of varying dramatic expression
(think of the first act of <i>Don Giovanni</i>) of deepest, briefest
pathos and swift humour, a dozen perfect songs or concerted
pieces, in the time it takes for that old <i>poseur</i>, Amfortas, to
squirm over his Grail, or Kundry to break the ice with Parsifal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Even <i>Tristan</i>, so incomparably finer than Wagner’s other
things, is indecent through its dragging out of situations, its
bellowing out of confessions which the natural human being
dreads to profane by showing or expressing. With all this goes
what to me is the chief psychological explanation of Wagner
(and of his hypnotic power over some persons), his <i>extreme
slowness of vital tempo</i>. Listening to him is like finding oneself
in a planet where the Time’s unit is bigger than ours: one is on
the stretch, devitalised as by the contemplation of a slug. Do
you know who has the same peculiarity? D’Annunzio. And
it is this which makes his literature, like Wagner’s music, so
undramatic, so sensual, so inhuman, turn everything into a
process of gloating. I had the good fortune (like Nietzsche) of
hearing <i>Carmen</i> just after the <i>Ring</i>. The humanity of it, and
the modesty also, are due very much to the incomparable
briskness of the rhythm and phrasing; the mind is made to
work quickly, the life of the hearer to brace itself to action.”</p>

</div>

<p>I think Arthur Strong would have agreed with every word
of this.</p>

<p>I had not been at Paris long before one evening after dinner
the telephone bell rang; I went to answer it and was told that
President Faure was dead. The staff of the Embassy walked
in the funeral procession to Notre Dame, in uniform. It was
a radiant day. The mourning decorations—a veil of crape flung
negligently across the façade of the Chamber of Deputies—the
banners, the wreaths, the draperies, were a fine example of the
French discretion and artistic instinct in decoration. On the
balcony of the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Sarah Bernhardt was
sitting wrapped in furs; with us were the Corps Diplomatique,
some officials from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; one
a composer of dance tunes, <i>Sourires d’Avril</i>, etc., once celebrated
all over Europe, now more forgotten than the songs of
Nineveh or Tyre. We laughed, we chattered, we ate chocolate,
we enjoyed the sunshine and the exercise, we gave no thought
to the man in the gorgeous coffin who had taken so much trouble
to ape and observe the forms of majesty, and who had been
rewarded with such merciless ridicule.</p>

<p>During the first fortnight I spent in the Diplomatic Service
there was a plethora of funerals which we had to attend; one
at the Greek Church; one at the Madeleine. Attending
funerals, and going to the station to meet royalties were both
important factors in Diplomatic life. Indeed, at a small post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
one seemed to spend half one’s life at the railway station. Some
of the secretaries were keen race-goers, and when, as sometimes
happened, they were not allowed to go because of possible work,
and they would point out that there was not likely to be any
work to do, Reggie Lister used wisely to remark that we were
not paid for the amount of work we did, but for hanging about
in case there should be any work. In spite of this, he used
generally to arrange things in such a manner that anyone who
wanted to go to the races could go.</p>

<p>Reggie Lister was an artist in life and the organisation of
life. He built his arrangements and those of others with a light
scaffolding that could be taken down at a moment’s notice and
rearranged if necessary in a different manner to suit a change of
circumstance. He was radiantly sensible. He had a horror
of the trashy and the affected, and his gaiety was buoyant,
boyish, and infectious. If he was really amused himself, his
face used to crinkle and his body shake like a jelly, “comme un
gros bébé,” as a Frenchman once said. His intuition was like
second-sight and his tact always at work but never obtrusive,
like the works of a delicate watch. I never saw anyone either
before or after who could make such a difference to his surroundings
and to the company he was with. He made everything
effervesce. You could not say how he did it. It was not
because of any exceptional brilliance or any unusual wit, or
arresting ideas; but over and over again I have seen him do
what people more brilliant than himself could not do to save
their lives, that is, transfigure a dull company and change a
grey atmosphere into a golden one. It was not only that
he could never bore anyone himself, but that nobody was ever
bored when he was there. You laughed with him, not at him.
He took his enjoyment with him wherever he went and he
made others share it.</p>

<p>His taste was fastidious, but catholic, and above all
things sensible. He was acutely appreciative of external
things: a walk down the <i>Champs Elysées</i> on a fine spring morning;
good cooking; dancing and skating, and he danced
like mad; he was never tired of telling one of his summer
travels in Greece; his first disappointment and his subsequent
delight in Constantinople—and nobody in the world could
tell such things as well. It was difficult to be more intelligent;
but his intelligence (and after a minute’s conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with him you could not but be aware of its acuteness), his love
and knowledge of artistic things, his shrewdness, his humour,
and rollicking fun, although taken all together, are still not
enough to account for the fascination that his personality
exercised over so many different people—over, I believe, almost
anyone he pleased, if he took the trouble. If his diplomatic
duties called for trouble of this kind, there was none he would
not take; if only his own private social life was concerned he
sometimes permitted himself the luxury of indifference; but
he never indulged in “le plaisir aristocratique de déplaire”;
although the company of celebrities tried him almost beyond
endurance, leaving a peevish aftermath for his friends to put
up with.</p>

<p>One instance is better than pages of explanation and
analysis.</p>

<p>One day Reggie Lister and myself each received a letter
from a friend in England asking us to be civil to a young French
couple who were newly married, and were just setting up house
in Paris. Reggie left cards on them, and they asked us both to
luncheon.</p>

<p>We found them in a small but extremely clean apartment on
the other side of the river, and as we went into the drawing-room
it seemed to be crowded with relations in black—mothers-in-law
and sisters-in-law, and aunts. All of them in deep
mourning. It reminded me of the opening scene of a one-act
play, which used to be popular many years ago, called <i>La joie
fait peur</i>. In that play, the curtain rises on a bereaved family
who are all of them steeped in inspissated gloom.</p>

<p>We went into the little dining-room and sat down to a
shiny mahogany table. An old servant tottered and pottered
about the room with a bunch of keys and a bottle of wine
covered with cobwebs. A rather grim mother-in-law sat at
the head of the table. The young, newly married couple were
shy. There was an atmosphere of stern, rigid propriety and
inflexible tradition over the whole proceeding. Formal phrases
were bandied, and all the time the mother-in-law, the aunts,
and the sisters-in-law, all of them dressed in crape with neat
white frills, never ceased to throw on the bashful young
couple the full searchlight of their critical observation. But
we had not been at the table many minutes before Reggie had
captivated the company, and at the end of five minutes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
were all screaming with laughter and talking at the top of their
voices. They were not laughing at him. They were laughing
with him.</p>

<p>This is just what Reggie Lister could do, and what I have
never seen anybody else succeed in doing, to that extent and in
such difficult circumstances. He had something which made
you, whoever was in the room, wish to listen to him, and
made you wish him to listen to you. He had also the gift
of making the witty wittier, the singer, the talker, the
musician, the reciter, do better than his best, of drawing
out the best of other people by his instantly responsive
appreciation.</p>

<p>The French of all classes appreciated and loved him, and
when he died they felt as if an essential part of Paris had been
taken away, and a part that nothing could replace. To be
with him at the same Embassy, as I was for a year and a half,
was an education in all that makes life worth living. But
what was life to me was, I am afraid, sometimes death to him,
as I tried him at times highly.</p>

<p>The Ambassador, Sir Edmund Monson, was academic with
a large swaying presence and an inexhaustible supply of polished
periods. A fine scholar and a master of precise and well-expressed
English and an undiminishing store of vivid reminiscence;
in the matter of penmanship he was passion’s
slave. Possibly my opinion is biased from having had to
write out so many of his dispatches on a typewriter, and so
often some of them twice, owing to the mistakes. Typewriting,
it is well known, is an art in which improvement is
rarely achieved by the amateur; one reaches a certain degree
of speed and inaccuracy, and after that, no amount of practice
makes one any better. If there were too many mistakes in a
dispatch it would have to be written out again. There never
seemed to be any reason why Sir Edmund’s dispatches should
ever end, and they were just as remarkable for quantity as
for length. He was exceedingly kind and always amiable,
to talk to or rather to listen to; he was the same in his dispatches;
one had the sensation of coasting pleasantly downhill
on a bicycle that had no break, and save for an accident
was not likely to stop.</p>

<p>Michael Herbert, the Councillor, was a complete contrast to
Sir Edmund in many ways. With him one felt not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
presence of a brake, but of steel-like grasp on that brake—a
steel-like grasp concealed by the suavest of gloves and a high,
refined courtesy and the appearance of a cavalier strayed by
mistake into the modern world. Never was there an appearance
more deceptive in some ways; in so far, that is to say, as it
seemed to indicate apathy or indifference or lack of fibre. He
had a will of iron and a fearless and instant readiness to shoulder
any responsibility, however grave or perplexing. He was a
man of action, and an ideal diplomat. At one of his posts
they called him “the butcher.” At that time the men who
enjoyed the highest reputation in the Diplomatic Service, and
who seemed to be the most promising, were perhaps Charles
Eliot, Cecil Spring-Rice, and Arthur Hardinge; and in every
one of these cases the promise was fulfilled; but as a diplomat,
I think anyone would agree, that Herbert excelled them all
and easily, although the others might be in one case more intellectual
or more brilliant, in another more erudite. Herbert
had a steely strength of purpose, a quick eye, and the power
of making up his mind at once, as well as a shrewd understanding
of the world and especially of the foreign world, and a
quiet far-sightedness. Moreover, he had the charm that arises
from natural and native distinction, and a subtle flavour which
came from his being intensely English, and at the same time
a citizen of the world, without any admixture of artificial
cosmopolitanism. He would have been at home in any period
of English history; whether at the Black Prince’s Court at
Bordeaux, at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, at Kenilworth, at
Whitehall, or at the Congress of Vienna.</p>

<p>Had he dressed himself up in the shimmering and sombre
satins and the waving plumes of the Vandyk period they would
have seemed to be his natural, his everyday clothes.</p>

<p>I could imagine him putting his inflexible determination,
expressed in thin, metallic tones of deferential and courteous
deprecation, lit up by gleams of a sharp and shy humour,
against the perhaps equally obstinate, but unfortunately less
wise and less constant, wishes of Charles <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> I can imagine
him, with his pale face and slight stoop, listening with quiet
appreciation to the jokes of Falstaff, at the first performance
of <i>Henry IV.</i>; or signing, without a flicker of hesitation, a
dispatch to Drake or Raleigh that would mean war with Spain;
or shutting his snuff-box with a sharp snap, as he saw through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
some subtle wile of Talleyrand; or listening, civil but quite
unabashed, to a storm of invective from Napoleon.</p>

<p>One day someone in the Chancery remarked on the peculiarly
nauseous odour of the food that is given to foxhounds. “I
like it,” he said. “I used to eat it as a child.”</p>

<p>I have always thought the most crucial test to which a new
piece of verse or a modern picture can be put is to imagine
what effect the verse would produce in an anthology of
another epoch or the picture in a gallery of old masters.
Herbert as a personality and as a diplomatist could have stood
any test of this kind, and placed next to any of the old masters
or the old masterpieces, in character and statesmanship,
without suffering from the comparison; indeed, so far from
suffering any eclipse, his personality would only have
emerged more signally and more distinctly, with the melancholy
suavity of its form and the unyielding resilience of its
substance.</p>

<p>In April 1899, the second centenary of the death of Racine
was celebrated in Paris by a performance of Racine’s <i>Bérénice</i>
at the Théâtre français. This performance was one of the
landmarks in my literary adventures. Bartet played Bérénice,
and I do not suppose that Racine’s verse can ever have been
more sensitively rendered and more delicately differentiated.
Between the acts, M. Du Lau, a fine connoisseur of life and art,
took me behind the scenes and introduced me to Bartet. They
talked of the play. Around us hovered an admiring crowd,
and whispered homages were flung to the artist, like flowers.
It was like a scene in a Henry James novel, a page from the
<i>Tragic Muse</i>. They agreed that Racine’s loveliest verses were
in this play: “Des vers si nuancés,” as Du Lau said. Bartet
wore a lilac cloak over white draperies, and a high ivory diadem,
and when we said good-bye Du Lau kissed her hand and said:
“Bon soir, charmante Bérénice.”</p>

<p>If anyone is inclined to think Racine is a tedious author
they cannot do better than read <i>Bérénice</i>. It is the model
of what a tragedy should be. The drama is simple and
arises naturally and inevitably from the facts of the case, which
are all contained in one sentence of Suetonius: “Titus Reginam
Berenicen, cui etiam nuptias pollicitus ferebatur, statim ab
urbe dimisit invitus invitam.” That is to say, Titus loved
Bérénice and, it was believed, had promised her marriage. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sent her away from Rome, against his own will as well as against
hers, as soon as he came to the throne.</p>

<p>It is the eternal conflict between public duty and personal
inclination.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“With all my will, but much against my heart,</div>

<div class="verse">Go thou to East,</div>
<div class="verse">I West.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Coventry Patmore’s Ode sums up the whole tragedy. The
sentiments the characters express are what any characters
would have said in such a situation now or a thousand years
ago, and would be just as appropriate and true if the protagonists
of the drama belonged to Belgravia or to the Mile End Road.
The verse is exquisite.</p>

<p>Antiochus, who loved Bérénice in vain, says to her as he
leaves her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Que vous dirai-je enfin? je fuis des yeux distraits,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui me voyant toujours ne me voyaient jamais.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The tragedy is full of musical lines, sad and suggestive and
softly reverberating, with muted endings such as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dans l’Orient désert quel devint mon ennui?</div>
<div class="verse">Je demeurai longtemps errant dans Césarée,</div>
<div class="verse">Lieux charmants, où mon cœur vous avait adorée,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and some of the most poignant words of farewell ever uttered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Pour jamais! Ah Seigneur! songez-vous en vous-même</div>

<div class="verse">Seigneur, que tant de mers me séparent de vous?</div>
<div class="verse">Que le jour recommence et que le jour finisse,</div>
<div class="verse">Sans que jamais Titus puisse voir Bérénice.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Prince of Wales passed through Paris and stayed there
a night that winter and dined at the Embassy, and we had to
wear special coats and be careful they had the right number of
buttons on them.</p>

<p>I got to know a good many French people, and some of those
who had been famous in the days of the Second Empire: Madame
de Galliffet and Madame de Pourtalès. Madame de Pourtalès
had grey hair, but time, which had taken away much from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and stamped her with his pitiless seal, had not taken, and was
destined never to take, away the undefinable authority that
alone great beauty possesses, and never loses, nor her radiant
smile, which would suddenly make her look young.</p>

<p>Once at a party at Paris many years after this, at the
Jaucourts’ house, I again saw Madame de Pourtalès. It was
not long before she died. Her hair was, or seemed to be, quite
white, and that evening the room was rather dim and lit from
the ceiling; her face was powdered and she appeared quite
transfigured; the whiteness of her hair and the effect of the
light made her face look quite young. You were conscious only
of dazzling shoulders, a peerless skin, soft shining eyes, and a
magical smile. She put out everyone else in a room. She
looked like the photographs of herself taken when she was
a young woman. One saw what she must have been, and
everybody who was there agreed that here was an instance of
the undefinable, undying persistence of great beauty that just
when you think it is dead, suddenly blooms afresh and gives
you a glimpse of its own past.</p>

<p>Reggie Lister told me that he had once asked Madame de
Pourtalès what was the greatest compliment that had ever been
paid her. She said it was this. Once in summer she had been
going out to dinner in Paris. It was rather late in the summer,
and a breathless evening, she was sitting in her open carriage,
dressed for dinner, waiting for someone in the clear daylight.
It was so hot she had only a tulle veil round her shoulders.
While she was waiting a workman passed the carriage, and
when he saw her he stood and gaped in silence; at last he said:
“Christi! que tu es belle!”</p>

<p>I had already written some short parodies of four French
authors which I wished to get published. A friend of mine
sent them to Henri de Régnier and asked his advice. His
opinion was extremely favourable. He said, and I quote his
words, so that he may bear the responsibility for my publishing
such a thing in Paris: “J’ai lu les amusants pastiches de M.
Baring. Bourget, Renan, Loti ou France pourraient avoir
écrit chacun des pages qui soient moins eux.” “Il faut pour
avoir fait cela une science bien délicate de la langue française.
Conseillez donc à Monsieur Baring de faire imprimer une petite
plaquette. Elle representerait à elle seule de gros livres, ce qui
sera délicieux.” I sent the parodies to Lemerre and he accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
them, and they were published in Paris by his firm. The
pamphlet was called <i>Hildesheim</i>, and the small edition was soon
sold out. The little book was well received by the French, and
I got a good deal of fun out of it.</p>

<p>Another literary adventure I had at this time was a correspondence
I started in the <i>Saturday Review</i>. Max Beerbohm,
in an article on a French translation of <i>Hamlet</i>, said something
about the French language being lacking in suggestiveness and
mystery. I wrote a letter saying that the French language was
as suggestive to a Frenchman as the English language was to an
Englishman, upon which a professor wrote to say that the French
language was only a bastard language, and that when a Frenchman
wrote of a girl as being <i>beaucoup belle</i> he was talking pidgin-Latin.
Many people then wrote to point out that the professor
was talking pidgin-French, and a certain H. B. joined in the fray,
quoting the “Chanson de Roland,” and saying that an Englishman
who used the phrase <i>beaucoup belle</i> in France would be
treated with the courtesy due to strangers, but a Frenchman
would be preparing for himself an unhappy manhood and a
friendless old age. It was a terrible comment, he added, on
the modern system of primary education. The controversy
then, as nearly always happens, wandered into the channel of
a side-issue, where it went on merrily bubbling for several
weeks.</p>

<p>English people used to stream through Paris all the year
round. One was constantly asked out to dinner, both by them
and by the French. One night I dined with Admiral Maxse, and
the other guest was M. Clemenceau. M. Clemenceau was in those
days conducting a violent campaign for Dreyfus in the Press,
and was a thorn in the flesh of the Government. I was severely
reproved for dining with him the next day. I knew a few
Frenchmen of letters: M. Henri de Régnier, Melchior de Vogüé,
André Chevrillon, Edouard Rod, Madame Darmesteter.</p>

<p>I remember at one of Anatole France’s receptions (I only
attended very few, as in those days a foreigner felt uncomfortable
in circles where the Dreyfus case was being discussed—it
was too much of a family affair) Anatole France talked of
Æschylus. He said the texts we possess of Æschylus are
shortened, abbreviated forms of the plays, almost, speaking
with exaggeration, like the libretto of an opera founded on a
well-known drama, almost as if we only possessed an operatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
libretto of <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Faust</i>, but he added: “Pourtant ceux qui
ont admiré Aschyle ne sont point des imbéciles.”</p>

<p>But literature was rarely discussed anywhere in those days,
as <i>L’affaire</i> dominated everything and excluded all other
topics.</p>

<p>In August came the Rennes trial, and the excitement reached
its climax. Galliffet was minister of war, and I heard him make
his first speech in the Chamber. “Assassin!” shouted the
left. “C’est moi, Messieurs,” said Galliffet, and waited till they
had finished. During the month of August, he used to dine
every night at the “Cercle de l’Union.” The club was quite
deserted. I used often to sit at his table.</p>

<p>He told me that many people in the Club would probably
not speak to him when they returned, for his having accepted
the portfolio at such a time. “They will turn their backs on me
probably,” he said. “Mais,” he added, with a chuckle, “ils
ne se permetteront pas une impertinence.” He used to tell
me many interesting things. He said the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen in his life was Georgiana, Lady Dudley,
at one of the early Paris Exhibitions, and after her, Madame
de Castiglione. I never knew whether he had believed in the
guilt or innocence of Dreyfus, but I knew he was determined the
case should end somehow and by a verdict which should bring
about an <i>apaisement</i>.</p>

<p>The General was a picturesque and striking figure, not tall
nor imposing, but carved, as it were, in some enduring granite-like
substance, with steely eyes, a quick, rather hoarse, jerky
utterance, and a very direct manner, a little alarming to a newcomer,
owing to its abrupt frankness, and his way of saying
what he thought in the most pointed, Gallic manner. His
illustrations, too, and his confessions were sometimes startling.</p>

<p>In conversation he leapt over all conventions, with the same
gaiety and gallantry that had made him say at Sedan: “Tant
que vous voudrez, Mon Général.” In the early days of the
case he had been strongly in favour of revision.</p>

<p>When the verdict of the Court of Rennes was announced,
and Dreyfus subsequently pardoned, a curious thing happened.
Although the topic had been raging daily for years to the
exclusion of everything else, exciting everywhere the fiercest
passions, and dividing every family in France, estranging friendships,
and breaking careers, the very moment the decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was made known, the topic dropped from the minds of men
instantly and finally, as though it had never existed.</p>

<p>My own point of view, which I sometimes found was shared
by others, was that I believed Dreyfus to be innocent, but I
loathed the Dreyfusards. Commenting on this, Andrew Lang
wrote to me: “People like us, who hate vivisection and anti-vivisectionists,
who believe Dreyfus was innocent and loathe
Dreyfusards (though anti-Dreyfusards were really worse), have
no business on this foolish planet.”</p>

<p>I often went to the play, and the chief enjoyment I derived
was from what Sarah Bernhardt did in those days, about most
of which I shall deal with separately. She must have a chapter
to herself. Of the rest I remember but little except a revival
of <i>La Belle Hélène</i> with its enchanting tunes, and some funny
songs at Montmartre; Réjane in <i>Zaza</i> and <i>La Robe Rouge</i>,
and a terrifying play at the Théâtre Antoine called <i>En Paix</i>,
about a man who is shut up in a lunatic asylum, when he is
sane, and who ends by going mad. This play was said not only
to have been founded on fact, but to have been written by a
man whose brother had been shut up in a private lunatic
asylum by some conspiring greedy relations.</p>

<p>The man whose brother was thus treated went to Law, but
without avail, so as a last resource he wrote a play in which
he exposed the facts, which were briefly these: A greedy family
wish to get one of their members out of the way. They say
he is mad and get him sequestered in a mad-house. He has a
just brother who tries to get him released, but the brother finds
himself faced with the obstinacy of professionalism when he
declares the sequestered man is not mad; the lunatic experts
say he does not understand the intricacies of the disease, and
when he loses his temper, the doctors say: “You, too, are
showing signs of the family madness.” The man who is shut
up is quick tempered; a sojourn with lunatics sharpens his
temper, and the play ends by his being dragged out by sinister-looking
warders, crying out: “A la douche!” I could
not sleep after seeing this spectacle, which lost nothing
in the realistic interpretation of actors such as Antoine and
Gémier.</p>

<p>In September, I went for a short time on leave, and stayed
at Lynton, North Devon, with the Cornishes in a delightful
little house called the Chough’s Nest. It was a warm, soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
windy Devonshire September. Hubert and I bathed in the
great breakers. We had wonderful teas in the valley, and
followed the staghounds on Exmoor. We talked of all the
books under the sun, and I wrote a poem in blank verse which
was afterwards published in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Review</i>.</p>

<p>Later in the autumn, I stayed a few days at a château near
Fontainebleau, and saw the forest in all the glory of its autumn
foliage, with the tall trees ablaze, like funeral torches for the
dying year; and the gardens of the château, and the splendid
rooms seemed more melancholy than ever, as though the ghosts
of the kings and queens of France were there unseen; and,
looking at the gorgeous raiment of the fading forest, I thought
of Mary Stuart putting on her most splendid robes on the
morning of her execution, and mounting the scaffold in flaming
satin.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“And all in red as of a funeral flame,</div>
<div class="verse">And clothed as if with sunset.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are no sadder places in the world than Versailles, Fontainebleau,
and Compiègne; those empty, deserted shells where
there was once so much glory and so much gaiety, so much
bustle and so much drama, and which are now hollow museums
laid bare to the scrutiny of every profane sight-seer.</p>

<p>During the autumn of 1899, in Paris, I received a visit from
Reggie Balfour, whom I had known at Cambridge, although he
went to Cambridge after I had left. He was a brilliant scholar
and had done great things at Cambridge. He had been staying
at Angers to study French. We talked of books, of the Dreyfus
case, and he suddenly said that he felt a strong desire to become
a Catholic. I was extremely surprised and disconcerted.
Up till that moment I had only known two people who had
become Catholics: one was a relation, who had married a
Catholic, and the other was an undergraduate, who had never
discussed the matter except to say he must have all or nothing.
When Reggie Balfour told me this I was amazed. I remember
saying to him that the Christian religion was not so very old,
and so small a strip in the illimitable series of the creeds of
mankind; but that if he believed in the Christian revelation,
and in the Sacraments of the Anglican Church, he would find
it difficult to turn round and say those Sacraments had been an
illusion. I begged him to wait. I said there was nothing to
prevent his worshipping in Catholic churches without committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
himself intellectually to a step that must cramp his freedom.
I advised him to live in the porch without entering the building.
I said finally: “My trouble is I cannot believe in the first
proposition, the source of all dogma. If I could do that, if
I could tell the first lie, I quite see that all the rest would
follow.”</p>

<p>He took me one morning to Low Mass at Notre Dame des
Victoires. I had never attended a Low Mass before in my life.
It impressed me greatly. I had imagined Catholic services
were always long, complicated, and overlaid with ritual. A
Low Mass, I found, was short, extremely simple, and somehow
or other made me think of the catacombs and the meetings
of the Early Christians. One felt one was looking on at something
extremely ancient. The behaviour of the congregation,
and the expression on their faces impressed me too. To them
it was evidently real.</p>

<p>We worked together at some poems I had written, and
Reggie arranged to have a small pamphlet of them privately
printed for me, at the Cambridge University Press, which was
done that Christmas.</p>

<p>When we got back to London, he sent me this epitaph, which
is translated from the Latin, and is to be found at Rome in the
Church of St. John Lateran, the date being about 1600:</p>

<p>“Ci-gît Robert Pechom, anglais, catholique, qui après la
rupture de l’Angleterre avec l’église, a quitté l’Angleterre ne
pouvant y vivre sans la foi et qui, venu à Rome y est mort ne
pouvant y vivre sans patrie.”</p>

<p>The next year saw the opening of the Exhibition. On the
17th of March, I went with Reggie Lister to the first night
of <i>L’Aiglon</i>. It was a momentous first night. All the most
notable people in the literary and social world of Paris were
there: Anatole France, Jules Lemaître, Halévy, Sardou, Robert
de Montesquiou, Albert Vandal, Henry Houssaye, Paul Hervieu,
Coquelin, Madame Greffuhle. The excitement was tense.
Sarah had a tremendous reception. When she spoke the line,
which occurs in the first scene, “Je n’aime pas beaucoup que la
France soit neutre,” there was a roar of applause, but this, one
felt, was political rather than artistic enthusiasm. The first
quiet dialogue between the Duke and the courtiers held the
audience, and we felt that Sarah’s calm and biting irony portended
great reserves held in store, and when the scene of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
history lesson followed, which Sarah played with an increasing
accelerando and crescendo, and when she came to the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Il suit l’ennemi; sent qu’il l’a dans la main;</div>
<div class="verse">Un soir il dit au camp: ‘Demain!’ Le lendemain,</div>
<div class="verse">Il dit en galopant sur le front de bandière:</div>
<div class="verse">‘Soldats, il faut finir par un coup de tonnerre!’</div>
<div class="verse">Il va, tachant de gris l’état-major vermeil;</div>
<div class="verse">L’armée est une mer; il attend le soleil;</div>
<div class="verse">Il le voit se lever du haut d’un promontoire;</div>
<div class="verse">Et, d’un sourire, il met ce soleil dans l’histoire!”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">she carried them off with a pace and an intensity that went
through the large theatre like an electric shock. People were
crying everywhere in the audience, and I remember Reggie Lister
saying to me in the <i>entr’acte</i> that what moved him at a play or
in a book was hardly ever the pathetic, but when people did or
said splendid things.</p>

<p>The rest of the play, from that moment until the end, was
a triumphant progression of cunningly administered electric
thrills which were deliriously received by a quivering audience.</p>

<p>When it was all over and people talked of it the next and
the following days in drawing-rooms and in the press, the
enthusiasm began to cool down.</p>

<p>The following extracts from an article which I wrote in the
<i>Speaker</i> about it, immediately after the performance, give an
idea of the impression the play made at the time:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Rostand, thanks to his rapid and brilliant career,
and the colossal success of <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, is certainly the
French author of the present day who attracts the greatest
amount of public attention in France, whose talent is the most
keenly debated, whose claims are supported and disputed with
the greatest vehemence. His popularity in France is as great
as that of Mr. Kipling in England; and in France, as is the case
with Mr. Kipling in England, there are not wanting many and
determined advocates of the devil. Some deny to M. Rostand
the title of poet, while admitting that he is a clever playwright;
some say that he has no poetical talent whatsoever. In the case
of poetical plays the public is probably in the long run the only
judge. Never in the world’s history has it been seen that the
really magnificent poetical play has proved a lasting failure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
or a really bad poetical play a perennial success. Of course
there have been plays which, like other works that have come
before their season, the public have taken years to appreciate;
while, on the other hand, the public have patronised plays of
surprising mediocrity and vulgarity; these works, however,
have never resisted the hand of time. But in the main the
public has been right, and those who take the opposite view
generally belong to a class alluded to by Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng</div>
<div class="verse">By chance go right, they purposely go wrong.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Certainly in M. Rostand’s case, whatever may be the exact
‘place’ of his plays in the evolution of the world’s poetical
drama, one thing is quite certain: his plays are triumphantly
successful. This for a play is a merit in itself. After the
triumph of <i>Cyrano</i> it was difficult to believe that <i>L’Aiglon</i> would
attain the same level of merit and success, and never was
a success more discounted beforehand. For weeks <i>L’Aiglon</i>
was the main topic of conversation in Paris, and provided endless
copy for the newspapers. Another thing is certain: however
the æsthetic value of <i>L’Aiglon</i> may be rated in the future,
it constitutes for the present another gigantic success. Never
did a play come at a more opportune moment. At a time
when the French are thinking that their country has for a long
time been playing too insignificant a part in European politics,
when the country is still convalescent and suffering from the
vague discomfort subsequent on a feverish crisis, fretting and
chafing under the colourless mediocrity of a régime that falls
short of their flamboyant ideal, M. Rostand comes skilfully
leading a martial orchestra, and sets their pulses throbbing,
their ears tingling, and their hearts beating to the inspiring
tunes of Imperial France.</p>

<p>“M. Rostand’s play is certainly a forward step in his poetical
career. It has the same colour and vitality as <i>Cyrano</i>; the
same incomparable instinct for stage effect, the same skill and
dexterity in the manipulation of words which amounts to
jugglery, the same fertility in poetical images and felicitous
couplets that we find in his earlier works; but, besides this,
it has something that they have not—a graver atmosphere, a
larger outlook, a deeper note; the fabric, though the builder’s
skill is the same, is less perfect as a whole, more irregular, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in it we hear mysterious echoes, and the footfall of the Epic
Muse, which compensates for the unevenness of the carpentry.</p>

<p>“In <i>L’Aiglon</i> we breathe the atmosphere of the epic of
Napoleon. Although the scenes which M. Rostand presents
to us deal only with the sunset of that period, the glories and
vicissitudes of that epoch are suggested to us; we do not see
the things themselves, but we are conscious of their spirit, their
poetic existence and essence. M. Rostand evokes them, not
by means of palpable shapes, but, like a wizard, in the images
of his phrases and the sound of his verse, and thus we see them
more clearly than if they had been presented to us in the form
of elaborate tableaux or spectacular battle-pieces.</p>

<p>“The existence of Napoleon <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> was in itself a tragic fact.
Yet more tragic if, as Metternich is reported to have said of
him, he had ‘a head of iron and a body of glass.’ And a degree
more tragic still is M. Rostand’s creation of a prince whose
frail tenement of clay is consumed by ambition and aspiration,
and who is conscious, at times, of the vanity of his aspiration
and the hopelessness of his ambition. Thus tossed to and fro,
from ecstasy to despair, he is another Hamlet, born, not to
avenge a crime against his father, but to atone for his father’s
crimes. Perhaps the most poetical moment of the play is
when the prince realises, on the plain of Wagram, that he himself
is the atonement; that he is the white wafer of sacrifice offered
as an expiation for so many oceans of blood. M. Rostand has
chosen this theme, pregnant with pathos, as his principal
<i>motif</i>. It is needless to relate the play… The close of the
Fifth Act is perhaps the finest thing in conception of the whole;
in it we see Napoleon, after the failure of an attempted escape
to France, alone on the battlefield of Wagram, pale in his white
uniform on the great green moonlit plain, with the body of the
faithful soldier of the Old Guard, who killed himself rather
than be taken by the Austrians, lying before him. Gradually
in the sighing winds Napoleon imagines he hears the moans of
the soldiers who once strewed the plain, until the fancy grows
into hallucination, until he sees himself surrounded by regiments
of ghosts, and hears the groans, the call, and the clamour
of phantom armies growing louder and louder till they culminate
in the cry of ‘Vive l’empereur.’ He hears the tramping of
men, the champing and neighing of chargers, and the music of
the band; he thinks the ‘Grande Armée’ has come to life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
rushes joyfully to meet it; the vision is then dispelled, and the
irony of the reality is made plain, for it is the white uniforms of
the Austrian regiment (of which he is Colonel) that appear in
the plain. The scene is almost Shakespearean in its effect of
beauty and terror.</p>

<p>“Finally, in the last Act, we see the <i>Roi de Rome</i> dying in
his gilded cage while he listens to the account of his baptism
in Paris, which is read out to him as he dies. He who as a child
‘eut pour hochet la couronne de Rome’ is now an obscure
and insignificant Hapsburg princeling, dying forgotten by the
world, without a friend, and under the eye of his imperturbable
enemy.</p>

<p>“The play has already been accused of incoherence, lengthiness,
and inequality; of too rapid transitions, of a clash in
style between preciosity and brutality. It has been compared
unfavourably with <i>Cyrano</i>… Fault is found now, as it was
before, with the form of M. Rostand’s verses; they are no
doubt better heard on the stage than read in the study, and
this surely shows that they fulfil their conditions. His verses
are not those of Racine, of Alfred de Vigny, or of Lecomte de
Lisle … but they have a poetic quality and a value of their
own; and while their clarion music is still ringing in my ears
I should think it foolish to quarrel with them and to criticise
them in a captious spirit; possibly on reading <i>L’Aiglon</i> the
impression may be different. For the present, still under the
spell of the enthusiasm and shouts of applause which his couplets
inspired on the memorable first night of the play, I can but
thank the author who brought before my eyes, with the skilful
and clamorous music of his harps and horns, his trumpets and
fifes and drums, the vision of an heroic epoch and the shadows
of Homeric battles—the red sun and the cannon balls shivering
the ice at Austerlitz, the Pope crowning another Cæsar at
Notre Dame, Moscow in flames and the Great Army scattered
on the plains of Russia, and the lapping of the tideless sea
round St. Helena.”</p>

<p>Many of those who had been most enthusiastic at the first
night of <i>L’Aiglon</i> lost no time in saying they had been mistaken,
and that it was after all but a poor affair. Someone said that
Rostand’s verse was made <i>en caoutchouc</i>. I heard someone
ask Robert de Montesquieu his opinion soon after the play
was produced. He said he thought the verse was in the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Victor Hugo tradition; some of it, Metternich’s monologue
on Napoleon’s hat, very fine. Somebody mentioned the more
sentimental verses on <i>La Petite Source</i>: “Cela doit être,” said
Montesquiou, “de Madame Rostand.”</p>

<p>Arthur Strong, after he saw the play, told me it had carried
him away, and the fact of Sarah Bernhardt being a woman, and
not a young woman, had mattered to him no more than the
footlights or the painted scenery; he had accepted it, he had
been made to accept it gladly, by the fire of the play and the
power of the interpretation.</p>

<p>The Paris Exhibition of 1900 was opened on the 14th of
April, and the whole of the Embassy staff attended that
ceremony in uniform. I remember little of it. The features
of the Exhibition were the <i>trottoir roulant</i>, a moving platform,
that took visitors all round the Exhibition without their having
to stir a foot; the pictures in the Grand Palais; the little city
on the left bank of the Seine, where every nation was represented
by a house, and where, in the English house, there was
a room copied from Broughton Castle, full of Gainsboroughs;
the Petit Palais, a gem in itself; and, besides these, there
were the usual features of all exhibitions—side-shows, bales
of chocolate, and galleries full of machinery and implements.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April I was taken by M. Castillon de
Saint Victor for an expedition in a free balloon. I had been
up twice in a captive balloon in the Jardin d’Acclimatation, and
had not enjoyed the experience, especially once on a windy day.
I was not at all sure I was not going to dislike the free balloon,
and I felt a pang of fear whenever I thought of it beforehand;
but when the moment of starting came, and the balloon was
released, and rose as gently and as imperceptibly as a puff of
smoke from Saint Denis, and soared higher and higher into the
dazzling sky without noise, without our experiencing any effect
of motion or breeze, I felt intoxicated with pleasure. We
went up to three thousand feet. It was like reaching another
planet, an Olympic region of serenity and light, and one had no
desire to leave it or to descend again to the earth.</p>

<p>We ate luncheon from a basket and drank a little rum,
which was said to be the best beverage in a balloon, and we
took photographs from the air. I little thought that I should
one day have something to do with aircraft, air photographs,
and all the many details of air navigation. We floated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
across Paris in a south-easterly direction. We came down low
over a château belonging to the Rothschilds’ and over the
forest of Creçy; later in the afternoon, we dropped a guide
rope and floated over the country at a height of about two
hundred feet, and as the evening came on, the balloon came
down still lower and sailed along just over the tree-tops. Finally
we landed. The balloon hopped like a football, the basket car
was overturned, and the gas was let out. We landed in a
deserted piece of flat country, but no sooner was the balloon on
the ground than, as always happens, a crowd sprang from
nowhere and helped us. The balloon was put in a cart, and we
walked to the town of Provins, which was not far off, and there
we took the train to Paris. The next time I visited Provins
it was the General Headquarters of the French Army during
the latter part of the European War.</p>

<p>I spent a week of that spring at Fontainebleau and Chantilly.
There were a great many English people in Paris. One night,
at the opera, in a box, an English lady was sitting, a large
emerald poised high on her hair; the audience looked at nothing
else, and an old Frenchman, who had been an ornament of the
Second Empire, came up to me in the entr’acte and said:
“Il est impossible d’être plus jolie que cette femme.” Shortly
after this I travelled up to Paris from Fontainebleau with this
same lady. The train was crowded, and we just managed to
find room in the barest of provincial railway carriages. There
were some private soldiers in the carriage, and some substantial
women in sabots with large baskets. They gazed at her with
childish delight, unmixed admiration, and surprised wonder,
as she sat, making the boards of the third-class carriage look
like a throne, in cool, diaphanous, lilac and white muslins and
a large bunch of flowers, a vision of radiance and grace; it
reminded me of the large masses of lilies of the valley and roses
you suddenly meet with in a dark, narrow street corner on the
first fine day of spring in Florence.</p>

<p>We went to a shop in Paris where she wanted to buy a pair
of gloves. When she asked how much they were, the lady who
was serving her said: “Pour vous rien, Madame, vous êtes trop
jolie!”</p>

<p>I used to see a great deal of Monsieur and Madame de
Jaucourt, whom I could remember ever since the early days of
my childhood. Monsieur de Jaucourt had the most delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
way of expressing things. One day when Madame de Jaucourt
was pressing myself and another of the secretaries to stay with
them in the country, he said: “Ma chère, les jeunes gens ont
beaucoup mieux à faire que d’aller passer des heures à la
campagne!” He was passionately fond of Paris. “On me gâte
mon cher Paris,” he used to say. After luncheon, he would
interview the cook and discuss every detail of last night’s dinner,
praising this and criticising that, with extraordinary nicety and
precision; and when he gave a dance in his house for boys and
girls, on the afternoon preceding it, he would have different
samples of lemonade and orangeade sent up to taste and choose
from, to see if they were sweet enough but not too sweet. The
lemonade was for the juvenile buffet. Women’s bets used to
amuse him, and when they talked about racing, he would say:
“Les paris des femmes sont à crever de rire.” He was a connoisseur
of artistic things, and enjoyed a fine house, and beautiful
<i>objets d’art</i>. He insisted on my going to see the château of Vaux,
which he said was the finest house he knew. He said what
distinguished it from other houses was that it was not crammed
with valuable things for the sake of ostentation, show, or ornament,
but where a piece of furniture was wanted, there it would
be, and it would be a good one.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Jaucourt had a house not far from Paris in the
country, and I remember playing croquet one day there. His
daughter, Françoise, aimed carefully at the ball and missed the
hoop, upon which M. de Jaucourt said, with a sigh: “Ma pauvre
fille, tu as joué sans réfléchir.” I often used to dine at the “Cercle
de l’Union.” There were about four or five old men who used
to dine there every night; a few, a very few, younger men, but
no quite young Frenchmen.</p>

<p>One night someone arrived and asked for some cold soup.
There was none. In a fury of passion this member asked for
the book of complaints. When it was brought, he wrote in it:
“N’ayant pas pu trouver un consommé froid j’ai dû diner hors
du Club.”</p>

<p>One night the new house, built by Count Boni de Castellane
in the Bois de Boulogne, was being discussed. Someone said
it was like Trianon, and that it would be difficult to keep up.
Someone else who was there said: “Mais Boni est beaucoup plus
riche que Louis <span class="smcapuc">XIV</span>.” M. Du Lau and General Galliffet used
often to dine there to discuss the days of their youth and talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
over the beauties and even the wines of the past; General
Galliffet told us one night how he won sums of money by playing
with a piece of rope taken from a gibbet in his pocket, and that
the best wine he had ever drunk in his life was in the Rhine
country. Now they are all dead, and I suppose their place is
taken by those who were the older young men in those days,
but I have no doubt that they sit round in the same chairs and
sometimes complain if there is no <i>consommé froid</i> to be had.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1900, I went on leave to London for a few
weeks and attempted to pass an examination in International
Law after a few weeks’ preparation. I went up for the examination,
and I don’t think I was able to answer a single question;
my crammer told me I had not the legal mind. At the end of
the summer, I was told that the Foreign Office wanted me to go
to Copenhagen, and at the beginning of August I started for
Denmark as Third Secretary to Her Majesty’s Legation.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">COPENHAGEN</span></h2>

<p>I arrived at Copenhagen in August. I went there direct
from Paris and crossed whatever intervening seas lie
between Denmark and Germany <i>via</i> Hamburg and
Kiel. I had been given an ointment made of tar by a French
hair specialist to check my rapidly increasing baldness, and I
applied it before I went to bed in my cabin, which contained
three other berths. When the other passengers, who had intended
to share my cabin, put their heads into it, they were
appalled by the smell of tar, and thought that they had been
given berths in the sail-room by the steward. They complained
loudly, and refused to sleep there, so I had the cabin
to myself.</p>

<p>I stayed at the Hôtel d’Angleterre, and on the morning of my
arrival presented myself to the Minister, Sir Edward Goschen.
He was alone at the Legation. I took rooms in a street not far
from the Legation, and settled down to the quiet routine of
Legation life in a small capital.</p>

<p>Copenhagen in August seemed unusually quiet. The sentries
outside the Amalienborg Palace looked like big wooden dolls
in their blue uniforms, white trousers, white belts, and bearskins.</p>

<p>I immediately began to have Danish lessons from the
British Vice-Consul, who was a Dane, and we soon began to read
Hans Andersen in Danish. The diplomatic world in Copenhagen
was a little world by itself. It consisted of the Russian
Minister, Count Benckendorff, who, when I arrived, was there
by himself; the Austrian Minister, Count Wildenbruch, who
lived at the Hôtel d’Angleterre, and never went out and rarely
saw anybody; the French Minister, M. Jusserand, one of the
most erudite of English scholars besides being one of the most
charming of Frenchmen; and the German Minister, M. Schön,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
who had a passion for dressing up in fancy dress; the Norwegian
Minister, M. de Knagenhjelm; and the Italian Minister.</p>

<p>The diplomatic world mixed little with the Danes. I
once heard a Dane say to another Dane: “Do you receive
diplomats?” in the same tone of surprise as would have
been appropriate had the question been: “Do you receive
police-spies?”</p>

<p>I think the theatres were shut when I arrived, and the only
amusements were to go out sailing which I used to do often
with Sir Edward, who had a yacht, and in the evenings to have
dinner at the Tivoli music-hall, which was an out-of-door park
full of side-shows and was pleasantly illuminated.</p>

<p>The staff of the British Legation consisted of a First Secretary,
Sir Alan Johnstone, and a Chancery servant: a Dane called
Ole, who was a charming, simple person like a character in
Hans Andersen, vaguely intoxicated sometimes, paternal, easily
upset, and endlessly obliging.</p>

<p>Sir Alan Johnstone had a little house in the country, and
there I often used to spend Sunday, and there I made the acquaintance
of Count Benckendorff. The first time I met him
we had a violent argument about the Dreyfus case. He was a
firm believer in Dreyfus’ innocence and so was I, but that did
not prevent us arguing as though we held diametrically opposite
opinions.</p>

<p>In the middle of August, Edmund Gosse paid a visit to Denmark
and I went to him meet at Munkebjerg, which entailed
a long cross-country journey over many canals and in trains
that were borne on steamers. Munkebjerg was a lovely place
on the top of a high hill with little woods reaching down to the
water. There, for the first time, I experienced the long, green,
luminous twilights of the north. Edmund Gosse was inspired
by the surroundings to write a book called <i>Hypolympia</i>, which
he afterwards dedicated to me. He imagined that the gods of
Greece arrived at Munkebjerg immediately after their exile,
and on that theme he wove a fantasy.</p>

<p>One of the most important duties at Copenhagen was to go
to the railway station to meet the various royalties who used
to visit the King of Denmark, and another one was to receive
English Royalties at the door of the English church when they
attended divine service on Sundays. We used often to see
the King of Denmark out riding, and although I think he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
then eighty years old, he looked on horseback, so extraordinarily
young was his figure, like a man of thirty.</p>

<p>I learnt Danish fairly quickly and soon I could follow the
plays at the Kongelige Theatre and at other theatres. The
Kongelige Theatre was a State-supported institution with an
ancient tradition and an excellent troupe of actors and dancers.
They performed opera: Gluck, Mozart, and Wagner; ballets;
the classic Danish comedies of Holberg; Molière; Shakespeare;
modern comedies and the dramas of Ibsen, Tolstoy, and Holger
Drachman. The Shakespeare productions were particularly
interesting and far more remarkable than any I ever saw in
Berlin. They made use of the Apron Stage; on a small back-cloth
at the back of the stage changed with the changing scene;
the back-cloth was framed in a Gothic arch, which was supported
by pillars raised on low steps. A curtain could be lowered
across this arch, and the actors could proceed with the play in
front of this curtain, without necessitating the lowering of the
larger curtain. This small scene was extremely effective. It
was just enough to give the eye the keynote of the play; and
in the historical plays of Shakespeare, in <i>Richard III.</i> for
instance, it was ideal. I saw <i>Richard III.</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, and <i>A
Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>; the latter was a beautiful and gay
production; the actor who played Bottom had a rich vein of
humour and a large exuberant personality, and the fairy dances
were beautifully organised and executed. Of the modern
drama I saw Tolstoy’s <i>Powers of Darkness</i>, which made a
shattering effect, Ibsen’s <i>Doll’s House</i> and <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, and
Holger Drachman’s <i>Gurre</i>, and some comedies by Otto Benzon.</p>

<p>The performance of the <i>Doll’s House</i> with Fru Hennings’
Nora was unforgettable. I have seen many Noras; Eleonora
Duse and Réjane and Agnes Sorma in Berlin; but Fru
Hennings played the part as if it had been written for her; she
<i>was</i> Nora; she made the whole play more than natural, she
made it inevitable. “Quelle navrante ironie! quel désenchantement
à fond!” said Jules Lemaître, writing about Duse’s performance
of Magda. In Fru Hennings’ interpretation of Nora,
the irony was indeed harrowing, and the disenchantment complete;
but irony, disillusion, weariness, disgust were all merged
into a wonderful harmony, as the realities of life gradually
dawned on the little singing-bird, and the doll changed into a
woman. She made the transformation, which whenever I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
seen the play before seemed so difficult to believe in, of the Nora
of the first act into the Nora of the last act seem the most
natural thing in the world. Then Fru Hennings had the
advantage of being a Dane and of speaking the words of the
play in the language in which they had been written. She
had a musical rippling voice and a plaintive grace of gesture.
Holger Drachman’s drama <i>Gurre</i> was a terrible and intensely
dramatic poetic drama, with a love duet of impassioned lyricism
and melody, and an almost unbearable scene, in which the
Queen has her rival scalded to death in a steam-bath. <i>Hedda
Gabler</i> I confess to not being able to endure when I saw it; it
was beautifully acted; too well acted; there seemed to be no
difference between what was going on on the stage and in the
audience. I had a sudden uprush of satiety with Norwegian
drama: with Ibsen, with problem plays, with Denmark, with
the North; and I remember going out of the theatre after the
second act, in revolt and disgust, and not being able to stand
any more of it. But that was an accidental impression arising
from a surfeit of such things, and from an overdose of Scandinavian
gloom and Norwegian complexity; a short course of
musical comedies would have soon enabled one to appreciate
the drama of Ibsen once more; as it was, I heard it after a
year and a half’s stay at Copenhagen, and at that moment I
had had just a drop too much of that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I also saw <i>When we dead awaken</i> when it was first produced,
and this again had no effect on me, save one of vague and
teasing perplexity.</p>

<p>The music at Copenhagen was as interesting as the drama.
Mozart’s operas were admirably given at the Kongelige Theatre.
I remember a fine performance of <i>Don Giovanni</i>, the <i>Nozze
di Figaro</i>, and Gluck’s <i>Orpheo</i>, concerts where Beethoven’s
Symphonies were played, and a recital of Paderewski where
he played Liszt’s arrangement of the <i>Erlkönig</i>. When he came
to the end of it, the impression was that he himself had
experienced that ride in the night; that he had battled with
the Erl King for the life of the child, and that it was he and
not the child who was dead.</p>

<p>As soon as I could speak Danish, I made several friends
among the Danes. I sometimes spent the evening at Dr. George
Brandes’ house, and more often at that of Otto Benzon, the
playwright, who was extremely kind to me. The <i>intelligentsia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of Copenhagen were highly cultivated; they were well-to-do
and had fine collections of modern pictures. The meals were
long and were often followed by a still longer supper. The
days were short in winter at Copenhagen; the sun appeared
to set at two; the wind blew in every direction at once down
the Bred Gade. Copenhagen in winter had depressing elements.</p>

<p>I had, in the meantime, made great friends with the Benckendorffs
at the Russian Legation.</p>

<p>Just as in the art of writing, and in fact in all arts, the best
style is that where there is no style, or rather where we no
longer notice the style, so appropriate and so inevitable, so
easy the thing said, sung, or done is made to appear, so in
diplomacy the most delightful diplomats were those about
whom there was no diplomatic style, nothing which made you
think of diplomacy. Michael Herbert was one of these, and so
pre-eminently was Count Benckendorff. When he was Ambassador
in London he took root easily in English life, and made
friends instantly and without effort in many different worlds,
so his personality and his services are well known to Englishmen.
I doubt, however, whether they know how great the
services were which he rendered at times both to our country
as well as to his own.</p>

<p>All through the war, till a few days before his death, he was
giving his whole heart and soul to his work, and every nerve
of his being was strained to the utmost. The war killed him
as certainly as if he had fought in the trenches. He was
astonishingly far-sighted and clear-sighted. In 1903 he told me
there would be a revolution in Russia directly there was a war.
At the time of the Agadir crisis, he told me that the future of
Europe entirely depended on the policy of the German Government:
on whether the German Emperor and his Government
decided or not to embark on a Louis <span class="smcapuc">XIV.</span> policy of ambition
and aggression, and try to make Germany the only European
power.</p>

<p>When the Emperor of Russia issued the manifesto of 17th
October, and the Russians were bedecking their cities with
flags, because they thought they had received a constitution,
he made it excruciatingly clear that it was nothing of the kind;
and he predicted no less clearly what would be the results of so
ambiguous an act, and so dangerously elastic a charter.</p>

<p>His public career belongs to history. I had the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of knowing him as a private person and of finding in him the
kindest and the wisest of friends.</p>

<p>I think his most striking quality was his keenness. The
way he would throw himself into the discussion, the topic, or
the occupation of the moment, whether it was a book, a play, a
picture, a piece of music, a political question, a wolf-hunt, a
speech, a problem, even an acrostic to be guessed, or the dredging
of a pond.</p>

<p>Whenever I wrote anything new he always made me read
it aloud to him, and he was in himself an extraordinarily
exhilarating and encouraging public.</p>

<p>He was all for one’s doing more and more, for finding out
what one could not do and then doing it.</p>

<p>He once tried to persuade me to go into Parliament. When
I objected that I had no power of dealing with political questions,
and no understanding of many affairs that a member of Parliament
is supposed to understand, he said: “Rubbish! You could
do all that part, just as you wrote a parody of Anatole France;
people would think you knew.”</p>

<p>He hated pessimism. He hated the Oriental, passive view
of life, especially if it was preached by Occidentals. The looking
forward to a Nirvana and a closed door. He hated everything
negative. Suicide to him was the one unpardonable
sin. He hated affectation, especially cosmopolitan affectation,
what he used to call “le faux esprit Parisien.” “Je préfère,”
he used to say, “le bon sens anglais.” He was extremely
argumentative and would put his whole soul into an argument
on the most trivial point; and he was as unblushingly unscrupulous
as Dr. Johnson in his use of the weapons of contradiction,
although, unlike Dr. Johnson, however heated the argument, he
was never rude, even for a second; he didn’t know how to be
rude. He spoke the most beautiful natural French, the French
of a more elegant epoch than ours, with a slightly classical
tinge in it. He spoke it not only as well as a Frenchman, but
better; that is to say, he spoke without any frills or unnecessary
ornament, either of phrase or accent, with complete ease and
naturalness.</p>

<p>He spoke English just as naturally. I remember on one
occasion, shortly after he arrived in London, his being taken
for an Englishman throughout a whole dinner-party by his
host. But he used to say that this was sheer bluff and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his command of the language was limited. His beautiful
manners, and the perfection of his courtesy came from the same
absence of style I have already alluded to. He was natural and
unaffected with everyone, because he was <i>chez soi partout</i>; and
his distinction, one felt, was based on a native integrity, a
fundamental horror of anything common, or mean, or unkind,
the incapacity of striking a wrong note in word or deed: the
impossibility of hurting anyone’s feelings. A member of the
Russian <i>intelligentsia</i>, writing in a provincial newspaper in
Russia, about one of the many European crises that threatened
Europe before the outbreak of the Great War, said: “We
should have been dragged into a war, had we not had at the
time, as our Ambassador in London, the first gentleman in
Europe.” That is, I think, his best and most fitting epitaph.</p>

<p>I shall never have the benefit of his criticism any more, his
keenness, his almost boyish interest, his decided, argumentative
disagreement leaping into a blaze over a trifling point, and
never again enjoy that glow of satisfaction—worth a whole
world of praise—which I used to feel when he said about something,
whether a poem, a newspaper article, a story, or a letter,
or the most foolish of rhymes: “C’est très joli.”</p>

<p>I moved from my rooms in the town to the Legation and
had most of my meals with the Goschens. Sir Edward’s inimitable
humour, his minute observation of detail, and his
keen eye for the ludicrous, the quaint and all the absurd incidents
of daily life—and especially of diplomatic life—made
all the official side of things, the dinner-parties, the interviews
with ministers, the ceremonies at the station, the pompousness
of the diplomats, extraordinarily amusing. Besides this, he was
childishly fond of every kind of game, such as battledore and
shuttlecock, and cup and ball.</p>

<p>Sir Edward went on leave in the autumn of 1900, and for a
fortnight, from 10th October to 22nd October, I had the glory
of being in charge, of being acting Chargé d’Affaires of the
Legation, so that when the Foreign Office wrote to me they
signed dispatches, “Yours with great truth.” The first thing
which had to be done was to leave cards on all the <i>Corps
Diplomatique</i>. This duty was always carried out by Ole, the
Chancery servant. I gave him a sheaf of my cards to leave;
he left some of them, but I think he considered that I was
altogether too young to be taken seriously as a Chargé d’Affaires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
so he left no cards on the minor diplomats, who lived out of the
immediate radius of the British Legation. About three days
after I had been in charge, Count Benckendorff told me that
the minor diplomats who had received no cards from me had
held a meeting of indignation; I was to lose no time in smoothing
down their ruffled sensibilities, so I left the cards myself.
The only diplomatic interview I remember having was with
the future King of Greece, who came to see me in my room
and talked about something I didn’t understand. My brief
era of sole responsibility was put an end to after a fortnight by
the arrival of a new First Secretary in place of Alan Johnson.
His name was Herbert. Shortly after his arrival Ethel Smyth
paid a visit to Copenhagen on her way back to England from
Berlin, where she had been negotiating for the performance of
her opera, <i>Der Wald</i>. She wanted to make the acquaintance
of the Benckendorffs, and she sang her opera to us, her Mass,
and many songs of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Grieg, besides
many English and Scotch ballads. Count Benckendorff, who
was musical, was enchanted with her singing, with her interpretation
of the songs she sang, “<i>la richesse de son exécution</i>,”
her vitality, her good humour, her keenness, her passionate
interest in everything. She played golf in the daytime and
made music in the evening.</p>

<p>At Christmas, Sir Edward’s sons arrived and we had a
Christmas-tree in the house, and a treat for the church choir, and
endless games of battledore and shuttlecock in the Legation
ballroom. Then, suddenly, came the unbelievable news that
Queen Victoria was dead. A telegram arrived on the 22nd
January, worded thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am profoundly grieved to inform you that the Queen
expired this evening at six-thirty. Notify melancholy intelligence
to Government.”</p>

</div>

<p>I was just going home for a little leave, but now it seemed
impossible: there would be too much to do. But Sir Edward
insisted on my going, all the same. Herbert was arriving back
from leave, and he said he could get on without me; so I went.
I saw the funeral procession from a house near the Marble Arch.
The only splash of colour in the greyness and gloom of the long
procession was the regalia and the bright pall on the gun-carriage
that bore the coffin, and everyone agreed that the most imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
figure in the procession was the German Emperor in a great
grey cloak. But the most impressive feature of the whole
ceremony was the attitude of the crowd: its size, its silence,
the universal black. London was like a dead city, and as
someone said at the time: “One went about feeling as if one
had cheated at cards.” I felt that what “Onkel Adolph” used
to say at Hildesheim was true: “<i>Die Engländer lieben ihre alte
Königin</i>” (“The English love their old Queen”).</p>

<p>In February I went to Karlsruhe to hear Ethel Smyth’s
first opera, <i>Fantasio</i>, performed at the Hofteater with Mottl
conducting. <i>Fantasio</i> is an opera in two acts written on
Musset’s play. Ethel Smyth wrote the libretto herself in
German. The opera contains some lovely songs, especially
one that begins: “<i>Reite ohne Sattelpferd</i>,” and some of the
most delicate music Ethel Smyth ever composed, but the
libretto is undramatic, and there are not enough bones in the
framework to support the musical structure. Mottl conducted
the orchestra beautifully; the opera was respectfully received,
but without any great enthusiasm. When the performance
was over, we had supper with the Grand Duchess of Baden,
and there I met a cousin of mine, Charlie d’Otrante, whom I
had not seen since I was a child. He was now, though a Swedish
subject—his father was a Swede—an officer in the German
Army.</p>

<p>I stayed at Copenhagen till the spring. The spring in
Denmark comes with a rush. All is wintry, without any hint
of the coming change, and then all of a sudden, and in one
night, the beech trees are green, and of so startling, vivid, and
fresh a green that it almost hurts the eye, and through them you
see the sea, a milky haze, and the sky looks as if it had been
washed clean.</p>

<p>In May, I went to London for my first spell of long leave
since I had passed my examination. I stayed all June and
July in London, and in the middle of July I went over to Brittany
to stay a few days with Sarah Bernhardt at her house, the Fort
des Poulains on the island of Belle-Isle, which is at the extreme
north of the island. This visit entailed a terrific journey:
first, a long train journey with many changes, then several
hours on board a steamer, and then a two hours’ drive. The
house was a little white, square, flat-roofed building among
the rocks and a stone’s-throw from the sea—a great roaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
grey sea, with huge breakers, leaping cataracts of foam,
and beaches of grey pebbles. Sarah Bernhardt’s son was
staying there, Clairin, the artist, and one or two other people.
The house was built entirely of pitch-pine inside. Sarah used
to appear at <i>déjeuner</i>.</p>

<p>She spent all the morning working. In the afternoon she
played lawn-tennis on a hard court; after dinner we played
every kind of game. She was carrying on at the time a heated
discussion by telegraph with the poet Catulle Mendès about
the forthcoming production of a poetical play of his, called
<i>La Vierge d’Avilon</i>. The dispute was about the casting: the
poet wished one of the female parts to be played by a certain
actress; Sarah wished otherwise. Telegram after telegram
was sent and received, each of them several pages in length.
The poet’s telegrams were lyrical and beautifully expressed.
One of them began: “Vous êtes puissante et câline,” and
another addressed her as “La grande faucheuse des illusions.”
How the matter was settled ultimately, I never knew. During
the whole time I stayed there, Sarah never mentioned the
theatre, acting, or actors, except as far as they concerned this
particular business discussion. On the other hand, she talked
a great deal of her travels all over the world. She talked of
Greece, and I quoted to her the line of some French poet about
“des temples roux dans des poussières d’or,” and asked her
whether it was an accurate description. She said: “Yes, of the
Greek temples in Italy”; but, in Greece, she said it was a case
of “des temples roses dans des poussières d’argent.” She said
the most remarkable sight she had ever seen in her life was in
Australia, when, in a large prairie, she had seen the whole sky
suddenly filled with a dense flock of brilliantly coloured birds,
which had risen all at once from the ground and obscured the
whole horizon with their dazzling coloured plumage.</p>

<p>She was irresistibly comic at times, full of bubbling gaiety
and spirits, and an admirable mimic. Jules Huret wrote, while
I was at Paris, an article about her, in which he described this
side of her admirably.</p>

<p>“Quand elle veut,” he said, “Sarah est d’un comique
extraordinaire, par l’outrance de ses images toujours justes, et
la violence imprévue de ses reparties. Cette gaieté de Sarah
est bien caractéristique de sa force. C’est évidemment un
trop plein de sève qui se résout en joie. Elle a des trouvailles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
des mimiques, des répliques, une verve, des silences mêmes,
qui font irrésistiblement éclater le rire autour d’elle. Elle
imite certains de ses amis avec une vérité comique incroyable.”</p>

<p>What struck me most about her, when I saw her in private
life, was her radiant and ever-present common-sense. There
was no nonsense about her, no pose, and no posturing. She
was completely natural. She took herself as much for granted
as being the greatest actress in the world, as Queen Victoria
took for granted that she was Queen of England. She took it
for granted and passed on. She told me once she had never
wished to be an actress—that she had gone on to the stage
against her will; she would greatly have preferred to have been
a painter, and all her life she continued to model as it was,
and did some interesting things in this line, especially some
bronze fishes and sea-shapes for which she found models at
Belle-Isle, but when she found she had got to be an actress, she
said to herself: “If it has got to be, then I will be the first.”</p>

<p>She said she had never got over her nervousness in playing a
new part, or for the first time before a new audience; if she felt
the audience was friendly, this knowledge half-paralysed her;
if, on the other hand, she knew or guessed the audience to be
hostile, every fibre in her being tightened for the struggle.
She said that first nights at Paris, when she knew there would
be hostile elements and critics ready to say she could no longer
act, always gave her the greatest confidence; she felt then it
was a battle, and a battle she could win; she would force the
critics to acknowledge that she could act. She told me, too,
she had never gone an inch out of her way to seek for friends or
admirers; she had always let them come to her; she had never
taken any notice of them till they forced their attention on her.
At Belle-Isle I never once heard her allude to any of her parts
or to any of her triumphs; but she talked a great deal about
current events—of the people and politicians she had met in her
life, in all the countries of Europe—and said some very shrewd
things about the men who were ruling England at that time.</p>

<p>I stayed at Belle-Isle three or four days, then I went back
to London, and at the end of July I started for Russia. I had
been invited to stay with the Benckendorffs at their house in
the country, Sosnofka in the Government of Tambov. I did
not yet know one word of Russian. At Warsaw station I had
to get out and change. I left my bag for a moment on the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the carriage. This bag contained my money, my ticket,
my passport, and several other necessaries. When I came back
it was gone. I couldn’t even tell anyone what had happened.
As the result of a conversation in dumb show, I was put into
a train; it was not the express it should have been, but a slow
train, and then I had my first experience of the kindness and
obligingness of the Russian people, for a fellow-traveller registered
my luggage, bought me a ticket, telegraphed to the
Benckendorffs for me, to the hotel at Moscow, and supplied me
with food and money for the journey, which in this train took
three days.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kindness of this traveller, I arrived safely at
Moscow, and at Sosnofka the next day. It was a blazing hot
August that year in Russia. The country was burnt and
parched; the green of the trees had been burnt away. Sosnofka
is a large straggling village, with thatched houses. Once
every seven years the whole village would probably be burnt
down. Russia was very different from what I had expected.
I had read several Russian books in translations—Tolstoy
and Tourgenev—but the background they had formed in my
mind was not like Russia at all. In fact, I had never thought
of these books as happening in Russia. The people they
described were so like real people, so like people that I had
known myself, that I had always imagined the action taking
place in England or France. I imagined <i>Anna Karenina</i>
happening in London. Not only did the characters seem real
and familiar to me, but they struck me as being the <i>only</i> characters
I had ever met in any books which gave me the impression
that I had myself known them. Dickens’ characters are
real enough, and Thackeray’s characters are realistic enough;
I believe absolutely in Sam Weller, in Mr. Micawber, in Mr.
Guppy, in Mrs. Gamp, Mrs. Nickleby, and any you like to
mention; the genius of Dickens has made me believe in them;
I also believe in the existence of Major Pendennis and Becky
Sharp; I feel I might meet people like that, but I never have;
whereas with the characters in Tolstoy’s books I am not sure
whether they belong to bookland at all; I am not at all sure
they do not belong to my own past, my own limbo, which is
peopled by real people and dream people. The background
which I called up in my mind was something quite unconnected
with Russian books, and something far removed from reality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
It was the conventional background borrowed from detective
stories, and Jules Verne’s <i>Michael Strogoff</i>, and from many
melodramas. That is to say, I imagined barbaric houses,
glittering and spangled bedizened Asiatic people. The reality
was so different. Russia seemed such a natural country.
Everybody seemed to be doing what they liked, without any
fuss; to wear any clothes they liked; to smoke when and
where they wished; to live in such simplicity and without
any paraphernalia at all.</p>

<p>As for the landscape, my first impression was that of a
large, rolling plain; a church with blue cupolas; a windmill
and another church. The plain is dotted with villages, and
every village is like the last; the houses are squat, sometimes
built of logs and sometimes built of bricks, and the roofs are
thatched with straw. The houses stand at irregular intervals,
sometimes huddled close together and sometimes with wide
gaps between them; it was dusty when I arrived; the broad
road, which is not a real road, but an immense stoneless track
like the roads in America and Australia, was littered with
straw and various kinds of messes, and along it the creaking
carts groaned, the peasants driving them leisurely and sometimes
walking beside them. Every now and then there was a
well with a large wooden see-saw pole to draw the water with;
and everywhere, and over everything, the impression of space
and leisureliness and the absence of hurry. The peasants wore
loose shirts, with a leather coat thrown carelessly over their
shoulder, or left in the cart, and the women looked picturesque
in their everyday clothes; the folds of their prints and calicoes,
which had something Biblical and statuesque about them, were
more impressive to the eye than the silken finery which they
wore when they went to church on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Benckendorffs lived at Sosnofka in two small separate
two-storied houses, which were close together. The kitchen
was in a separate building apart. In the pantry, the night-watchman,
André, would play draughts in the daytime with
Alexei, who cleaned the boots. By night the watchman
watched; and every now and then blew a whistle. The butler,
Alexander, was an old soldier in every sense of the word. His
ingenuity had no end; nor had his resource. He could make
anything and do anything; and in the course of one revolving
noon he could be chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
could not only play, but he could make any musical instrument.
He was an expert mixer of fireworks, an inspired carpenter,
and he could mend anything. He bore the traces of an early
military training and drill in his upright shoulders; and about
once a month he would disappear and be drunk for two or
three days. The house was housemaided by two old Russian
peasants, Mavra and Masha, who wore kerchiefs over their heads
and speckled calico shawls. Mavra’s devotion to the Benckendorff
children passed all expression; she cared little for her
fate and fortune and for that of her own family as long as they
were alive and well. Michael, the coachman, was another great
character; he wore a black cap with peacocks’ feathers sticking
upright in it, and a black tunic with red sleeves. He drove
the <i>troika</i>, three horses abreast, and no road, or rather no absence
of road, daunted him; on the edge of an impossible hill, with
no track through it, and nothing in sight but bushes and logs,
and nothing to guess at except holes, if asked whether it was
possible to go on, he would always laconically answer, “<i>Moshno</i>”
(“Possible”), and it always was possible. There was an under-coachman
called Fro. He had his qualities too; and one of
these was the way in the winter he would find and recognise a
track after there had been a blizzard, which had entirely obliterated
all semblance or trace of any path or roadway. Sometimes
a little bit of paper or a stray twig would give him the
clue. Only one felt just this: that Michael would have been
quite unshaken in face of any catastrophes; the earth might
have opened in front of one, a hostile aeroplane might have
barred the way, a regiment of machine-gunners might have
been reported to be in ambush—he would just have nodded
and quietly said, “<i>Moshno</i>,” and nothing more.</p>

<p>After dinner, that summer we used to sit on the balcony
or on a stone terrace on one side of the house, and watch the
message of light, the warning halo the rising moon sent up
from behind the hill before she rose:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Perchance an orb more wondrous than the moon</div>
<div class="verse">Trembles beneath the rim of the dark hills,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and listen in the thick dark night, while the peasants in the
village stamped their rhythmical dances to the accompaniment
of bleating accordions or three-stringed balalaikas; some watchman’s
rattle beat time; the frogs croaked, and sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
voice—a rather hoarse, high, slightly sharp voice—began a long-drawn-out,
high wail, and other voices chimed in, singing the
same melody in a rough counterpoint. We sat at a little
green garden-table drinking our coffee, and our <i>nalivka</i>, the
delicious clean liqueur distilled from cherries. There seemed
to be no time in Russia. People slept when they felt
inclined, not necessarily because it was night. Once when
I went to stay with a friend near Kirsanof he advised me
to arrive at four o’clock in the morning, if possible, as the
servants would enjoy the <i>bustle</i> of someone arriving when it
was still dark.</p>

<p>One evening we went out riding through the woods, and
over the plains, and no sooner had we left the front door than
my pony, altogether out of control, galloped away into space.
One morning we were called at one, and went out to the marshes
to shoot wild duck before the dawn. It was quite dark when
we started, and after the shooting was over, and I shot two
wild duck dead, we drove home in the dawn across the dewy
plains, when the whole country was awakening, the cocks
crowing and the birds singing, and the plains were bathed in
lemon-coloured light, and faint pink and grey clouds hung
like shreds from Aurora’s scarf across the horizon.</p>

<p>One night we camped out in the woods. We took bottles
of beer and water-melons, and playing-cards, and a camera,
and many rugs. We slept little; the wood was full of flies
and mosquitoes, but we enjoyed ourselves much all the same,
and came back with that pleasant headache which is the
result of sleeping on straw in the open air on a hot August
night, and covered with bites. The morning after, we had a
wolf-shoot, but it was too early in the year for wolves, and
nobody saw one. But there was a great display, nevertheless;
a man rode on a white horse and blew a trumpet, and there
were a multitude of beaters. I remember a short dialogue
bawled slowly, quietly, and sonorously in prolonged accents
across a whole field between André, the night-watchman, and
Wassili, the keeper. “Who is that man yonder?” asked
Wassili. “He is a shepherd,” said André; “he feeds sheep.”
“On pastukh, on past korov.” It was so dignified, so slow,
like a fragment of dialogue from the Old Testament. In the
morning we used to have breakfast out of doors, in the garden,
under a tree, with a pleasant after-breakfast interlude of smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and conversation; then Alexander and the gardener would
stroll into the garden, and there would be endless discussion
about the pulling down of some paling, or the repairing of some
fence or chair, or the painting of some room or gate; Alexander’s
volubility had no limit, and the gardener was extraordinarily
ingenious in twisting the meaning of anything into the opposite
of what had been said. We had luncheon at half-past twelve,
and sat afterwards on the terrace, till the great heat was over,
and then we would go out in the <i>troika</i>, and take tea and a
samovar with us, or find a samovar somewhere, and perhaps
bathe in the river. After dinner, when it was too cold to stay
out, we would sit indoors and play cards at the green table,
marking the score in chalk on the table; and Pierre Benckendorff,
who was not yet an officer, but still at the cadet college,
used to read out Mark Twain in German, or draw pictures,
or make me draw pictures, while he gave advice, or played
the treble of tunes on the pianoforte.</p>

<p>There were three little rooms on the ground floor of the
first house, which was built of wood. The first room into which
the small front hall led was Count Benckendorff’s sitting-room.
It had a writing-table; a table where there was an array of
long pipes, neatly arranged; a round table with a green cloth
on it, and a wooden cup and ball on a plate; a bookcase full of
books of reference, which were constantly consulted, whenever,
as so often occurred, there was a family argument. In this
room, near one of the windows, there was a deal drawing-table.
There were prints on the wall. The next room had
some old French wooden furniture painted with little flowers,
and a large grand pianoforte, and a comfortable corner round
the fireplace; in front of a window, which went down to the
ground and opened like a door, there was a stone terrace with
orange trees in pots on it and agapanthus plants (later there
were rose trees as well). Beyond this there was a third room
full of books, old books, the library of Count Benckendorff’s
grandfather—the books that had been modern in the eighteenth
century, in their dark brown calf bindings, and old marbled
papers; here was the newest edition of Byron in French,
the poems of Pope and Corneille and Voltaire and Gresset,
the letters of Madame de Sévigné, the memoirs of Madame
de Caylus, Napoleonic memoirs and the poems of Ossian,
Schiller’s plays, and an early edition of Gogol. Upstairs on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the landing, there was a cupboard full of every imaginable
kind of novel: the Tauchnitz novels of many ages, and French
novels of every description, the early Zolas, the early Feuillets,
and Maupassant’s first stories. Before going to bed, we would
dive into that cupboard, and one was always sure, even in
the dark, of finding something one could read. I have always
thought since then, the ideal bookcase would be that in which
you could plunge a hand into in the dark and be sure of extracting
something readable. In the stone-house, the boys
had each of them a sitting-room on the ground floor, and I
had a bedroom and sitting-room upstairs. Next to the school
library at Eton, that sitting-room proved to be my favourite
room in all the world and in all my life; and at its big table
I painted innumerable water-colours, and wrote four plays in
verse, two plays in prose, three long books in prose, besides
translating a book of Leonardo da Vinci and writing endless
letters and newspaper articles. In this room, one had the
feeling of the world forgetting by the world forgot, and one
was recalled to reality by a bell, or by Alexander coming up
to the room, as he always did, to say that tea was ready or
dinner, or that the horses were at the door.</p>

<p>I felt the charm of Russia directly I crossed the frontier;
and after a three weeks’ stay there I was so bitten by it that
I resolved firstly to learn Russian, and, secondly, to go back
there as soon as I could.</p>

<p>I went back to Copenhagen, and stopped some hours at
Moscow on the way, and saw the Kremlin, and had some
amusing adventures at Testoff’s restaurant. Pierre Benckendorff
had written down for me a list of things to ask for; one
of which was caviare, which in Russian is <i>ikra</i>. But when I
said <i>ikra</i> the waiters thought I said <i>igra</i>, which means play,
and merely turned on the great mechanical organ which that
restaurant then boasted of, and I could not get any caviare.</p>

<p>When I got back to Copenhagen, I at once had lessons in
Russian from the <i>psalomtchtchik</i> at the Russian Church.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September, King Edward <span class="smcapuc">VII.</span> arrived in Denmark
to pay his first visit to Denmark as King of England.
The King was to arrive at Elsinore in the <i>Osborne</i>. The Staff of
the Legation had received orders to go to Elsinore and meet
His Majesty on board the yacht. His Majesty was to land in
time to meet the King of Denmark, the Crown Prince and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the Danish Royal Family, the King of Greece, Queen Alexandra,
the Emperor and Empress of Russia, the Dowager Empress of
Russia, Prince and Princess Charles of Denmark, and other
members of the various Royal Families. We were to go in
uniform. The train started at eight. I have already said I was
living at the Legation, but my rooms were completely isolated
from Sir Edward’s house, and had no connection with them.
I had a Danish servant called Peter. He had been told to call
me punctually at seven. He forgot, or overslept himself. I
woke up by accident, and automatically, and found to my
horror it was twenty-five minutes to eight, and the station was
far off, and I had to dress in uniform. I dressed like lightning,
but it is not easy to dress like lightning in a diplomatic uniform;
the tight boots are a special difficulty. I had no time to shave.
I got a cab, and we drove at full gallop to the station, and I got
into Sir Edward’s carriage as the train was moving out of the
station. At Elsinore, we had fortunately some time to spare
before going on board the <i>Osborne</i>, and I was able to get shaved
in the village. Then we went on board and were presented to
the King, and kissed his hand on his accession.</p>

<p>That same night there was a banquet at the Palace of
Fredensborg for the King, to which the staff of the Legation
were invited. I remember only one thing about this dinner,
and that is that we were given 1600 hock to drink. It was
quite bitter, and had to be drunk with about five lumps of sugar
in a glass.</p>

<p>After dinner, we stood round a large room while the Kings
and Queens, the Emperor and Empresses and Princesses, went
round and talked to the guests; and this was the end of a
tiring day.</p>

<p>A few days later the King came to luncheon at the Legation.</p>

<p>There was one other Royal arrival which I shall never
forget. I cannot place its date, but I think it must have been
Queen Alexandra’s first visit as Queen to Copenhagen. But
what I remember is this, that while we were waiting on the
station platform, Queen Alexandra descended from the train
all in black, with long floating veils, and threaded her way
through the crowd of Royalties and officials, looking younger
than anyone present, with still the same fairy-tale-like grace
of carriage and movement that I remembered as a child, and
with the same youthful smile of welcome, and with all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
delicacy of form and feature heightened by her mourning and
her long black veils, whose floating intricacy were obedient and
docile to the undefinable rhythm of her beauty, and I remember
thinking of Donne’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“No spring, no summer beauty has such grace</div>
<div class="verse">As I have seen in one autumnal face.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I spent that Christmas at Copenhagen, and on the 7th of
January 1902 a dispatch came to say I had been transferred
from the post of a Third Secretary at His Majesty’s Legation
at Copenhagen to that of a Third Secretary of His Majesty’s
Embassy at Rome. Before I left Copenhagen I had finished
an article on Taine, an article on modern French literature, and
an article on Sully Prudhomme, for the new edition of the
<i>British Encyclopædia</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">SARAH BERNHARDT</span></h2>

<p>I said that Sarah Bernhardt should have a chapter to
herself.</p>

<p>“Les Comédiens,” said Jules Lemaître, “tiennent
beaucoup de place dans nos conversations et dans nos journaux
parce qu’ils en tiennent beaucoup dans nos plaisirs.” Amongst
all the many pleasures I have experienced in the theatre, the
acutest and greatest have been due to the art and genius of
Sarah Bernhardt. Providence has always been generous and
yet economical in the allotment of men and women of genius
to a gaping world. Economical, because such appearances are
rare; generous, because every human being, to whatever
generation he belongs, will probably, at least once during his
lifetime, have the chance of watching the transit, or a phase
of the transit, of a great comet.</p>

<p>This is especially true of actors and actresses of genius.
Their visits to the earth are rare, yet our forefathers had the
privilege of seeing Mrs. Siddons and Garrick; our fathers saw
Rachel, Ristori, and Salvini; and we shall be able to irritate
younger generations, when they rave about their new idol, with
reminiscences of Sarah Bernhardt.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, as in this case, the comet shines
through several generations. I have talked with people who
have seen both Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt, and with some
who declared that in the first two acts of <i>Phèdre</i>, Sarah Bernhardt
surpassed Rachel. Such was the opinion of that sensible
and conservative critic, Francisque Sarcey.</p>

<p>The actor’s art dies with him; but the rumour of it, when it
is very great, lives on the tongue and sometimes in the soul of
man, and forms a part of his dreams and of his visions. The great
of old still rule our spirits from their urns; and we, who never
saw Rachel, get an idea of her genius from the accounts of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
contemporaries, from Théodore de Banville and Charlotte Brontë.
Her genius is a fact in the dreams of mankind; just as the
beauty of Helen of Troy and the charm of Mary Stuart, whom
many generations of men fell in love with. So shall it be with
Sarah Bernhardt. There will, it is to be hoped, be great actresses
in the future—actresses filled with the Muses’ madness and constrained
to enlarge rather than to interpret the masterpieces
of the world; but Providence (so economical, so generous!)
never repeats an effect; and there will never be another
Sarah Bernhardt, just as there will never be another
Heinrich Heine. Yet when the incredible moment comes for
her to leave us, in a world that without her will be a duller
and a greyer place, her name and the memory of her
fame will live in the dreams of mankind. Sarah Bernhardt
delighted several generations, and there were many
vicissitudes in her career and many sharp fluctuations in the
appreciation she won from the critical both in France and
abroad; nor did her fame come suddenly with a rush, as it
does to actors and actresses in novels. Even in Henry James’
novel, <i>The Tragic Muse</i>, the development of the heroine’s
career and the establishment of her fame happens far too
quickly to be real. Henry James was conscious of this himself.
He mentions this flaw in the preface he wrote for the novel
in the Collected Edition of his works.</p>

<p>Sarah Bernhardt’s career shows no such easy and immediate
leap into fame, nor is it the matter of a few star parts; it
was a series of long, difficult, laborious, and painful campaigns
carried right on into old age (in spite of the loss of a limb),
and right through a European war, during which she played
in the trenches to the <i>poilus</i>; it was a prolonged wrestle with
the angel of art, in which the angel was defeated by an inflexible
will and an inspired purpose.</p>

<p>She made her début at the Théâtre français in 1862, in the
<i>Iphigénie</i> of Racine. Sarcey, writing of her performance, said:</p>

<p>“Elle se tient bien et prononce avec une netteté parfaite.
C’est tout ce qu’on peut dire en ce moment.” It was not until
ten years later that she achieved her first notable success in
<i>Le Passant</i>, by François Coppée, and that she was hailed as
a rising star as the Queen in <i>Ruy Blas</i>, at the Odéon, and
became, in her own words, something more than “la petite fée
des étudiants.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1872 she left the Odéon and entered the Théâtre français
once more. She reappeared in <i>Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with
partial success. In writing of this performance, Sarcey expressed
doubt of Sarah Bernhardt ever achieving power as well as grace,
and strength as well as charm. “Je doute,” he wrote, “que
Mademoiselle Sarah Bernhardt trouve jamais dans son délicieux
organe ces notes éclatantes et profondes, pour exprimer le
paroxysme des passions violentes, qui transportent une salle.
Si la nature lui avait donné ce don, elle serait une artiste complète,
et il n’y en a pas de telles au théâtre.”</p>

<p>It was during a performance of Voltaire’s <i>Zaïre</i>, on a stifling
night in 1873, that Sarah Bernhardt discovered she had
undreamed-of stores of energy and electric power at her disposal,
and under her control. She had rebelled against having
to act during the summer months. Perrin, the director of the
Théâtre français, had insisted. When the night came when
she was due to appear in <i>Zaïre</i> (August 6), she determined to
exhaust all the power that was in her, and as she was at that
time as frail as a sylph and was thought to be perilously
delicate (spitting blood), she decided to spite Perrin by
dying. She strained every nerve; she cried in earnest; she
suffered in earnest; she gave a cry of real pain when struck by
the stage dagger; and when it was all over she thought her last
hour must have come; and then she found to her amazement
that she was quite fresh, and ready to begin the performance
all over again. She realised then that her intellect and will
could draw when they pleased on her physical resources; and
that she could do what she liked with her vocal chords. This explains
a secret that often puzzled the spectators of her art—her
power of letting herself go, and after a violent explosion, just
when you thought her voice must be broken for ever by the
effort, of opening as it were another stop, and letting flow a
ripple from a flute of the purest gold.</p>

<p>It was in <i>Phèdre</i> that Sarah Bernhardt proved she possessed
not only grace but power; her rendering of Doña Sol in
<i>Hernani</i> (November 1877) definitely sealed her reputation, not
only as a tragic actress, but as the incarnation of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
new and exotic. And the world recognised her incomparable
talent for speaking verse.</p>

<p>In 1879, the Comédie française visited London, and all
London went mad about Sarah Bernhardt. She was not then
the star in a cast of mediocrities, she was a star in a dazzling
firmament of stars. Her fellow actors and actresses were
Coquelin, Got, Delaunay, Mounet Sully, Worms, Maubant, and
Febvre among the men; and among the women, Croizette,
Baretta, Madeleine Brohan, Reichemberg, and Madame Favart.
A more varied, excellent, and complete cast could not be imagined.
It was a faultless ensemble for tragedy and comedy,
for Racine, for Molière, for Victor Hugo, and for Alexandre
Dumas fils.</p>

<p>In 1880, the glory of this theatrical age of gold was eclipsed
and diminished by the flight of Sarah Bernhardt. After a
quarrel arising out of the performance of <i>L’Aventurière</i>, she
suddenly resigned, and, after a short season in London, in May
1880, started for America.</p>

<p>This rupture with the Théâtre français, which was largely
due to the adulation she received and the sensation she made
in London, was a momentous turning-point and break in her
career. When it happened, the whole artistic world deplored
it, and there are many critics in France and in England who
never ceased to deplore it; but a calm review of the whole
career of Sarah Bernhardt forces one to the conclusion that it
could not have been otherwise.</p>

<p>The whole motto of her life was: “Faire ce qu’on veut.” And
sometimes she added to this: “Lemieux est l’ennemi du bien.”</p>

<p>The Théâtre français at that time was indeed an ideal temple
of art for so inspired a priestess. But Sarah Bernhardt was
more than a priestess of art—she was a personality, a force, a
power, which had to find full expression, its utmost limits and
range; and if we weigh the pros and cons of the matter, I do
not think we have been the losers. Her art certainly did suffer
at times from her travels and her unshackled freedom; she
played to ignorant audiences, and sometimes would walk through
a part without acting; she played in inferior plays. On the
other hand, had she remained in the narrower confines of the
Théâtre français, we should never have realised her capacities
to the full. In fact, had she remained at the Théâtre français,
she would not have been Sarah Bernhardt. We should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lost as much as we should have gained. It is true we should
never have seen her in plays that were utterly unworthy of her.
On the other hand, we should never probably have seen her
<i>Dame aux Camélias</i>, her <i>Lorenzaccio</i>, her <i>Hamlet</i>. We should
never have had the series of plays that Sardou wrote for her:
<i>Fédora</i>, <i>Théodora</i>, <i>La Tosca</i>, etc. Some will contend that this
would have been a great advantage. But, despise Sardou as
much as you like, the fact remains it needs a man of genius
to write such plays, and not only a woman of genius, but Sarah
Bernhardt and none other, to play in them. In <i>Fédora</i>, Eleonora
Duse, the incomparable Duse, could not reach the audience.
And now, when these plays are revived in London, we realise
all too well, and the public realises too, that there is none who
can act them. It is no use acting <i>well</i> in such plays; you must
act tremendously or not at all. <i>La Tosca</i> must be a violent
shock to the nerves or nothing. When it was first produced,
Jules Lemaître, protesting against the play, said the main
situation was so strong, so violent, and so horrible, that it was
in the worst sense actor-proof, and so it seemed then. Now we
know better; we know by experience that without Sarah
Bernhardt the play does not exist; we know that what made
it almost unbearable was not the situation, but the demeanour,
the action, the passivity, the looks, the gestures, the moans,
the cries of Sarah Bernhardt in that situation. Had Sardou’s
“machine-made” plays never been written, we should never
have known one side of Sarah Bernhardt’s genius. I do not say
it is the noblest side, but I do say that what we would have
missed, and what Sardou’s plays revealed, was an unparalleled
manifestation of electric energy.</p>

<p>The high-water mark of Sarah’s poetical and intellectual
art was probably reached in her <i>Phèdre</i>, her <i>Hamlet</i>, and her
<i>Lorenzaccio</i>; but the furthest limits of the power of her power
were revealed in Sardou’s plays, for Sardou had the intuition to
guess what forces lay in the deeps of her personality, and the
insight and skill to make plays which, like subtle engines, should
enable these forces to reveal themselves at their highest pitch,
to find full expression, and to explode in a divine combustion.</p>

<p>There is another thing to be said about Sarah Bernhardt’s
emancipation from the Théâtre français. Had she never been
independent, had she never been her own master and her own
stage manager, she would never have realised for us a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
series of poetical visions and pictures which have had a deep
and lasting influence on contemporary art. We should never
have seen Théodora walk like one of Burne-Jones’s dreams come
to life amidst the splendours of the Byzantine Court:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tenendo un giglio tra le ceree dita.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We should never have seen La Princesse Lointaine crowned
with lilies, sumptuous and sad, like one of Swinburne’s early
poems; nor La Samaritaine evoke the spices, the fire, and the
vehemence of the Song of Solomon; nor Gismonda, with
chrysanthemums in her hair, amidst the jewelled glow of the
Middle Ages, against the background of the Acropolis; nor
Izéïl incarnating the soul and dreams of India. Eliminate
these things and you eliminate one of the sources of inspiration
of modern art; you take away something from D’Annunzio’s
poetry, from Maeterlinck’s prose, from Moreau’s pictures; you
destroy one of the mainsprings of Rostand’s work; you annihilate
some of the colours of modern painting, and you stifle
some of the notes of modern music; for in all these you
can trace in various degrees the subtle, unconscious influence
of Sarah Bernhardt.</p>

<p>The most serious break in the appreciation of her art, on
the part of the critics and the French public, did not come
about immediately after she left the Théâtre français. On the
contrary, when she played the part of Adrienne Lecouvreur
for the first time—this was in May 1880—in London, her
triumph among the critical was complete. I have an article
by Sarcey, dated 31st May 1880, in which he raves about the
performance he had come to London to see, and in which
he says, had the performance taken place in Paris, the
enthusiasm of the audience would have been boundless. The
most serious break in the appreciation of her art came about
after she had been to America, toured round Europe many
times, with a repertory of stock plays and an indifferent company,
and acted in such complete rubbish as <i>Léna</i>, the adaptation
of <i>As in a Looking-Glass</i>, of which I have already given a
schoolboy’s impressions. People then began to say they were
tired of her. It is true she woke up the public once more with her
performance of <i>La Tosca</i> in 1889, but in July 1889 Mr. Walkley
voiced a general feeling when he said: “I suspect she herself
understands the risks of ‘abounding in her own sense’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
quite as well as any of us could tell her. She knows her talent
needs refreshing, revitalising, rejuvenating.” He speaks of
“her consciousness of a need for a larger, saner, more varied
repertory. But,” he adds, “she will never get that repertory
so long as she goes wandering from pole to pole, with a new
piece, specially constructed for her by M. Sardou, in her pocket.”</p>

<p>Fortunately this consciousness of a need for a newer, saner
repertory took effect in fact, after Sarah Bernhardt came back
from a prolonged tour in South America. In the ’nineties she
took the Renaissance Theatre in Paris, and she opened her
season with a delicate and serious drama called <i>Les Rois</i>, by
Jules Lemaître.</p>

<p>I am not sure of the date of this performance, but she
played <i>Phèdre</i> at the Renaissance in 1893, and Lemaître said
that “Jamais, Madame Sarah Bernhardt, ne fut plus parfaite,
ni plus puissante, ni plus adorable.” She produced Sudermann’s
<i>Magda</i> in 1896, and Musset’s <i>Lorenzaccio</i> in December 1896,
and then she discovered Rostand, whose first play, <i>Les Romanesques</i>,
had been done at the Français, and turned him into the
channel of serious poetical drama.</p>

<p>She then built a theatre for herself, and gave us Rostand’s
<i>Samaritaine</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>L’Aiglon</i>, and a series of Classical matinées;
and from that time onward she never ceased to produce at least
one interesting play a year. That was a fine average, a high
achievement, and a real service to art. People seldom reflect
that it is necessary for managers and actors to fill their theatre,
and they cannot always be producing interesting experiments
that do not pay. Small blame, therefore, to Sarah Bernhardt,
if she sometimes fell back on Sardou, and all praise and
gratitude is due to her for the daring experiments she risked.</p>

<p>Among these experiments one of the most remarkable
of all was that of Jeanne d’Arc in <i>Le Procès de Jeanne
d’Arc</i>; another was as Lucrezia Borgia in Victor Hugo’s
play; and a third the hero of the charming poetical play <i>Les
Bouffons</i>. She found a saner, larger repertory, and crowned
her career by triumphing in <i>Athalie</i> in 1920.</p>

<p>Some French critics think her <i>Lorenzaccio</i> was the finest
of her parts. Lemaître said about it: “Elle n’a pas seulement
joué, comme elle sait jouer, son rôle: elle l’a composé.
Car il ne s’agissait plus ici de ces dames aux camélias, et de ces
princesses lointaines, fort simples dans leur fond, et qu’elle a su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
nous rendre émouvantes et belles, presque sans réflexion et
rien qu’en écoutant son sublime instinct. A ce génie naturel
de la diction et du geste expressifs, elle a su joindre cette fois,
comme lorsqu’elle joue Phèdre (mais que Lorenzaccio était plus
difficile à pénétrer!) la plus rare et la plus subtile intelligence.”</p>

<p>This is what M. J. de Tillet wrote about the performance in
the <i>Revue Bleue</i> of December 1896:</p>

<p>“Cette fois ç’a été le vrai triomphe, sans restrictions et sans
réserves. Je vous ai dit la semaine dernière qu’elle avait atteint,
et presque dépassé le sommet de l’art. Je viens de relire
Lorenzaccio, et ç’a été une joie nouvelle, plus rassise et plus convaincue,
de retrouver et d’évoquer ses intonations et ses gestes.
Elle a donné la vie à ce personnage de Lorenzo, que personne
n’avait osé aborder avant elle; elle a maintenu, a travers toute
la pièce, ce caractère complexe et hésitant; elle en a rendu
toutes les nuances avec une vérité et une profondeur singulières.
Admirable d’un bout à l’autre, sans procédés et sans ‘déblayage,’
sans excès et sans cris, elle nous a émus jusqu’au fond de l’âme,
par la simplicité et la justesse de sa diction, par l’art souverain
des attitudes et des gestes. Et, j’insiste sur ce point, elle a
donné au rôle tout entier, sans faiblesse et sans arrêt, une inoubliable
physionomie. Qu’elle parle ou quelle se taise, elle est
Lorenzaccio des pieds à la tête, corps et âme; elle ‘vit’ son
personnage, et elle le fait vivre pour nous. Le talent de Mme
Sarah Bernhardt m’a parfois plus inquiété que charmé. C’est
une raison de plus pour que je répète aujourd’hui qu’elle a atteint
le sublime. Jamais, je n’ai rien vu, au théâtre, qui égalât ce
qu’elle a donné dans Lorenzaccio.”</p>

<p>In Mr. Bernard Shaw’s collected dramatic criticism,
<i>Dramatic Opinions and Essays</i>, there is an interesting chapter
comparing the two artists in the part of Magda, in which he
says that Duse’s performance annihilated that of Sarah Bernhardt
for him. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that
it did the same for everyone. I saw Sarah Bernhardt play the
part superbly in Paris, and I saw Duse play the part superbly in
London, and I should have said that Duse lent the character a
nobility and a dignity that are not to be found in the text of
the play, and that Sarah Bernhardt made of Magda what the
author wanted her to be: a rather noisy, exuberant, vulgar,
successful <i>prima donna</i>, a <i>cabotine</i>, not without genius, and
with moments, when her human feelings were touched, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
greatness; that she portrayed the ostentation of the actress,
and the sudden intoxication of success and celebrity, with
their attendant disillusions, on a talented middle-class German
girl; and, when the note called for it, the majesty of motherhood,
to perfection; but let us assume that Duse in this part
gave something more memorable, and the part certainly suited
her temperament, her irony, her dignity, perhaps better than
any other, and gave her a unique opportunity for self-expression,
even at the cost of reality, and of the play. Let us go further,
and say that in Dumas’ <i>La Femme de Claude</i> Duse played the
part of Césarine, a Sarah Bernhardt part if ever there was one,
the part of a wicked, seductive woman; and made of her
creation in that part a trembling, quivering, living, vibrating
thing; an unforgettable study of vice and charm and deadly
wickedness and lure, which Sarah Bernhardt never excelled.
Even if we admit all this, the fact still remains that Sarah
Bernhardt could play a poetic tragedy in a fashion beyond
Duse’s reach; that she could play Phèdre and Cleopatra and
Doña Sol; and that Duse, in the rôle of Cleopatra, dwindled
and was overwhelmed by it. The critics forgot, when they
compared the two artists, the glory of Sarah Bernhardt’s past,
the extent of range of her present, the possibilities of her future;
her interpretations of Racine, of Victor Hugo; her understanding
of poetry and verse; they did not compare the whole
art of Duse with the whole art of Sarah Bernhardt, and had
they done so they would have at once realised the absurdity of
doing such a thing—an absurdity as great as to compare Keats’
poetry with Tolstoy’s novels, or Burne-Jones with George Sand.</p>

<p>The French critics were more discriminating, and anyone
who has the curiosity to turn up what Lemaître says of Duse in
<i>La Dame aux Camélias</i> will find a subtle and discriminating
contrast between the art of these two great actresses. Personally
I am thankful to have seen them both, and to have
thought each unapproachable in her own way.</p>

<p>From 1893 to 1903 Sarah Bernhardt’s career broadened and
shone in an Indian summer of maturity and glory, and it was
during this period that she produced the most interesting plays
of her repertory, and it was certainly during this period that
she received from French criticism the highest meed of serious
praise. But her career was by no means over in 1903. In 1920
all the theatres in Paris closed one day, so that all the actors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of Paris might see her play in <i>Athalie</i>; and as I write she is
still producing new plays.</p>

<p>In what did the magic, the secret of Sarah Bernhardt consist?
The mainsprings of her life and her career were indomitable
determination, blent with a fine indifference to the opinion
of the crowd, and a saving sense of proportion enabling her to
keep a cool head and a just estimate of worldly fame amidst a
tornado of praise, and sometimes in face of volleys of abuse.
But as to the secret of her art, when one has said that Sarah
Bernhardt worked like a slave until she attained a perfect
mastery over the means at her disposal; that her attitudes and
gestures were a poem in themselves; that if she played Phèdre
in dumb-show it would have been worth while going to see;
and that if she played Doña Sol in the dark it would have been
worth a pilgrimage to hear—when one has said this, one has
said nearly all that can be put into words, and one has said
nothing; one has left out the most important part, and in
fact everything that matters, because one has omitted her
personality, a blend of gestures, look, voice, movement, intonation
combined, and something else, the charm, the witchery,
the spell which defy analysis.</p>

<p>When as Cleopatra she approached Antony, saying: “Je
suis la reine d’Egypte,” the fate of empires, the dominion of
the world, the lordship of Rome, could have no chance in the
balance against five silver words and a smile, and we thought
that the world would be well lost; and we envied Antony his
ruin and his doom.</p>

<p>But this magic, this undefinable charm, is a thing which it
is useless to write about. One must state its existence, and
with a thought of pity for those who have not had the opportunity
of feeling it, and still more for those who are unable to
feel it, pass on. There is no more to be said. It is impossible,
too, to define the peculiar thrill that has convulsed an audience
when Sarah rose to an inspired height of passion. When the
spark fell in these Heaven-sent moments, she seemed to be
carried away, and to carry us with her in a whirlwind from a
crumbling world. It is fruitless to dwell at length on this
theme, but I will recall some minor occasions on which the
genius of Sarah Bernhardt worked miracles.</p>

<p>I remember one such occasion in the autumn of 1899. The
South African War had been declared, and a concert was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
held at the Ritz Hotel in aid of the British wounded. It was a
raw and dark November afternoon. In the drawing-room of
the Ritz Hotel there was gathered together a well-dressed and
singularly uninspiring crowd, depressed by the gloomy news
from the front, and suffering from anticipated boredom at the
thoughts of an entertainment in the afternoon. Sarah Bernhardt
walked on to the platform dressed in furs, and prepared
to recite “La Chanson d’Eviradnus,” by Victor Hugo, and an
accompanist sat down before the piano to accompany the recitation
with music. I remember my heart sinking. I felt that
a recitation to music of a love-song in that Ritz drawing-room
on that dark afternoon, before a decorous, dispirited crowd,
mostly stolid Britishers, was inappropriate; I wished the whole
entertainment would vanish; I felt uncomfortable and I pitied
Sarah from the bottom of my heart. Then Sarah opened her
lips and began to speak the wonderful lyric (I quote for the
pleasure of writing the words):</p>

<p class="noindent">she opened wide her raised arms, and one could have sworn
a girl of eighteen, “April’s lady,” was calling to her “lord in
May.”</p>

<p>When she had done, a great many people in the audience
were crying; the applause was deafening, and she had to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the whole poem over a second time, which she did, with the
same effect on the audience.</p>

<p>Another occasion which I shall never forget was the first
night that she played <i>Hamlet</i> in Paris. The audience was
brilliant and hypercritical, and the play was received coldly
until the first scene between Polonius and Hamlet. When
Hamlet answers Polonius’s question: “What do you read,
my Lord?” with his “Words, words, words,” Sarah Bernhardt
played it like this. (She was dressed and got up like
the pictures of young Raphael, with a fair wig; she was the
soul of courtesy in the part, a gentle Prince.) Hamlet was
lying on a chair reading a book. The first “<i>des mots</i>” he said
with an absent-minded indifference, just as anyone speaks
when interrupted by a bore; in the second “<i>des mots</i>” his
answer seemed to catch his own attention, and the third
“<i>des mots</i>” was accompanied by a look, and charged with an
intense but fugitive intention: something</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“between a smile and a smothered sigh,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">with a break in the intonation, that clearly said: “Yes, it is
words, words, words, and all books and everything else in
life and in the whole world is only words, words, words.”
This delicate shadow, this adumbration of a hint was instantly
seized by the audience from the gallery to the stalls;
and the whole house cried: “Bravo! bravo!” It was a fine
example of the receptivity, the flair, and the corporate intelligence
of a good French audience.</p>

<p>Personally I think her Hamlet was one of the four greatest
achievements of her career. I will come to the others later.
Excepting Sir Johnston Forbes Robertson’s Hamlet, it was
the only intelligible Hamlet of our time. One great point of
difference between this Hamlet and that of any other actors
I have seen is, whereas most Hamlets seem isolated from the
rest of the players, as if they were reciting something apart
from the play and speaking to the audience, this Hamlet spoke
to the other persons of the play, shared their life, their external
life, however wide the spiritual gulf might be between them and
Hamlet. This Hamlet was in Denmark; not in splendid isolation,
on the boards, in order to show how well he could spout
Shakespeare’s monologues, or that he was an interesting fellow.</p>

<p>Another point: her Hamlet is the only one I have seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
which there was real continuity, in which one scene seemed
to have any connection with the preceding scenes.</p>

<p>She had already shown what she could do in the progression
of a single scene by crescendo, diminuendo transition, and
modulation, in the dialogue with Ophelia—“Get thee to a
nunnery.” The transition between the tenderness of “Nymph,
in thy orisons be all my sins remembered,” and the brutality
of “I have heard of your paintings too, well enough,” was
made plausible by Hamlet catching sight of the King
and Polonius in the arras—a piece of business recommended,
I think, by Coleridge; but the naturalness and the progression
of this scene were a marvel; the profound gravity and bitterness
with which she spoke the words: “I am myself indifferent
honest: but I could accuse me of such things, that it were
better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful,
ambitious.” One seemed to be overhearing Shakespeare
himself in a confessional when she said that speech, and the
cynicism of the final words of the scene were whispered and
hissed with a withering, blighting bitterness, her voice sinking
to a swift whisper, as though all the utterance of the body
has been exhausted, and these words were the cry of a broken
heart. But an example of what I mean by the continuity of
the interpretation is when the play within the play is finished,
when Hamlet breaks up the whole entertainment by his startling
behaviour. In that scene Sarah Bernhardt was like a tiger;
her glance transfixed and pierced through the King, and
towards the end of the play within the play she crept across
the stage and climbed up on to the high, raised, balconied dais
on the right of the stage, from which he was looking on, and
stared straight into his face with the accusing, questioning
challenge of an avenging angel. But the point I want to make
is this: when that scene is over, most players take the interview
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, which follows immediately
after it, as though nothing had happened. Not
so Sarah Bernhardt; during the whole of this interview she
played in a manner which let you see that Hamlet was still
trembling with excitement from what had happened immediately
before; and this not only brought out the irony
and the point of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s flat conventionality,
but gave the audience the sharp sensation that
they were face to face with life itself. So was it throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
her Hamlet; each scene depended on all the others; and
the various moods of the Dane succeeded one another, like
clouds that chased one another but belonged to one sky,
and not like separate slides of a magic lantern.</p>

<p>The fight with Laertes was terribly natural; the business
of the exchange of swords, and the expression in Hamlet’s
eyes when he realised, and showed that he had realised, that
one of the swords was poisoned and now in his hands, which,
in the hands of mediocre players, becomes so preposterously
extravagant, was tremendous.</p>

<p>The whole performance was natural, easy, life-like, and
princely, and perhaps the most poignant scene of all, and what
is the most poignant scene in the play, if it is well played, was
the conversation with Horatio, just before the final duel when
Hamlet says: “If it be not to come, it will be now.” Sarah
charged these words with a sense of doom, with the set
courage that faces doom and with the underlying certainty
of doom in spite of the courage that is there to meet it. It
made one’s blood run cold.</p>

<p>Another occasion when Sarah Bernhardt’s acting seemed to
me tremendous, was a performance of <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>
not long before the war. I had seen her play the part dozens
of times, and during a space of twenty years both in Paris
and in London. She was not well; she was suffering from
rheumatism; the stage had to be marked out in chalk for her,
showing where she could stand up. She was too unwell to
stand up for more than certain given moments. I went to
see her with a Russian actress who had seen her play in St.
Petersburg or Moscow, and not been able to endure her acting;
she had seen her walk through a part before an indifferent
audience that wondered what her great reputation was founded
on. We arrived late after the second act, and I went behind
the scenes and talked to Sarah, and told her of this Russian
actress. She played the last three acts in so moving and
simple a manner, and the last act with such agonising poignancy
and reserve that not only was my Russian friend in tears,
but the actors on the stage cried so much that their tears discoloured
their faces and made runnels in their grease paint.</p>

<p>As we went away my Russian friend said to me that was
the finest bit of acting she had ever seen or hoped to see again.</p>

<p>Another time, I think it was 1896, I was present at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
performance of <i>Magda</i> in Paris at the Renaissance Theatre by
Sarah; in her own phrase, <i>le Dieu était là</i>, and I shall never
forget the thrill that passed through the audience when Magda,
at the thought of being separated from her child, let loose her
passion, and spoke the elemental love of a mother defending
her child. Here the <i>advocatus Diaboli</i> will chuckle and say
something about “tearing a passion to pieces.” This was just
what it was not. The tirade was concentrated and subdued,
and it culminated in a whisper which had the vehemence of a
whirlwind. The scene was interrupted by a spontaneous cry
of applause. I have sometimes heard applause like this before
and since, when Sarah Bernhardt has been acting, but I have
never seen the art of any other actor or actress provoke so
great and so loud a cry.</p>

<p>I said Sarah Bernhardt’s Hamlet was one of the four great
achievements of her career. These are what I think were the
others:</p>

<p>The greatest thing an actor or an actress can do is to create
a poet. It used at one time to be said that Sarah Bernhardt
had failed to do this. Yet the only really remarkable French
dramatic poet of modern times, whose plays really moved and
held the public, Edmond Rostand, was a creation of Sarah
Bernhardt. The younger generation of his time, and some men
of letters in France, but not all (Émile Faguet was a notable
exception, and Jules Lemaître writes of his art with great discrimination),
used to despise the verse of Edmond Rostand.
But whatever anyone can say about the literary value of his
work, there is no doubt about its dramatic value. Rostand
may or may not have been a great poet or even a great artist
in verse, but that he was a great poetical dramatist was proved
by the only possible test—that of the rapturous enthusiasm
of his audience, wherever and in whatever language his plays
are performed. Since Victor Hugo, he is the one writer of our
time, and the only writer in this century in the whole of Europe,
who made a direct and successful appeal to the public, to
the public in all countries where his plays were performed,
and stirred and delighted them to the depths of their being
through the medium of dramatic poetry. Surely this is no
mean achievement; besides this, even among French critics,
there are many who maintain that he is a genuine poet. Well,
Sarah Bernhardt is in the main responsible for Rostand, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had there been no Sarah there would have been no <i>Princesse
Lointaine</i>, and no <i>Cyrano</i> (for it was Coquelin’s delight in <i>La
Princesse Lointaine</i> which made him ask Rostand for a play),
no <i>Samaritaine</i>, and no <i>L’Aiglon</i>.</p>

<p>This is one of the achievements of Sarah Bernhardt. Another
and perhaps a more important achievement was accomplished
before this—her resuscitation of Racine. Let everyone
interested in this question get M. Émile Faguet’s <i>Propos de
Théâtre</i>. M. Faguet shows with great wealth of detail and
abundance of contemporary evidence that in the ’seventies,
until Sarah Bernhardt played in <i>Andromaque</i> and <i>Phèdre</i>,
Racine’s plays were thought unsuited for dramatic representation.
Even Sarcey used to say in those days that Racine was
not <i>un homme de théâtre</i>. Sarah Bernhardt changed all this.
She revealed the beauties of Racine to her contemporaries. She
put new life into his plays, and by her incomparable delivery
she showed off, as no one else can hope to do, the various and
subtle secrets of Racine’s verse.</p>

<p>She did the same for Victor Hugo when she played Doña Sol
and the Queen in <i>Ruy Bias</i>. Théodore de Banville, in his
<i>Camées Parisiens</i>, says there could never be another Queen in
<i>Ruy Bias</i> like Sarah, and that, whenever the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Elle avait un petit diadème en dentelle d’argent”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are spoken, the vision of Sarah Bernhardt will rise, as though it
were that of a real person, frail, slender, with a small crown
set in her wonderful hair.</p>

<p>Yet, when all is said and done, Sarah Bernhardt’s supreme
achievement is another and a fourth: her Phèdre. I do not
think that anyone will disagree with this. It was in <i>Phèdre</i>
that she gave the maximum of beauty, and exhibited the whole
range of her highest artistic qualities. In <i>Phèdre</i> her movements
and her gestures, her explosions of fury and her outbursts of
passion, were subservient to a commanding rhythm; from the
moment Phèdre walked on to the stage trembling under the
load of her unconfessed passion until the moment she descended
into Hades, <i>par un chemin plus lent</i>, the spectator witnessed
the building up of a miraculous piece of architecture, in time
and not in space; and followed the progressions, the rise, the
crisis, and the tranquil close of a mysterious symphony. Moreover,
a window was opened for him wide on to the enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
land: the realm of beauty in which there are no conflicts of
times and fashions, but in which all who bear the torch have
an equal inheritance. He saw a woman speaking the precise,
stately, and musical language of the court of Louis XIV., who,
by her utterance, the plastic beauty of her attitudes, and the
rhythm of her movements, opened the gates of time, and beyond
the veil of the seventeenth century evoked the vision of ancient
Greece. Or, rather, time was annihilated, seventeenth-century
France and ancient Greece, Versailles and Trézène, were merged
into one; he was face to face with involuntary passion and the
unequal struggle between it and reluctant conscience.</p>

<p>There was the unwilling prey of the goddess, “a lily on her
brow with anguish moist and fever dew”; but at the sound
of her voice and the music of her grief, perhaps we forgot all
this, perhaps we forgot the ancient tales of Greece, and Crete,
we forgot Racine and Versailles; perhaps we thought only of the
woman that was there before us, who surely was something more
than human: was it she who plied the golden loom in the
island of Ææa and made Ulysses swerve in mid-ocean from his
goal? Or she who sailed down the Cydnus and revelled with
Mark Antony? Or she for whom Geoffroy Rudel sailed to Tripoli,
and sang and died? Or she who haunted the vision but
baffled the pencil of Leonardo da Vinci? Or she who excelled
“all women in the magic of her locks,” and beckoned to Faust
on the Brocken? She was something of all these things, an
incarnation of the spirit that, in all times and in all countries,
whether she be called Lilith or Lamia or La Gioconda, in the
semblance of a “Belle Dame sans Merci,” bewitches the heart
and binds the brain of man with a spell, and makes the world
seem a dark and empty place without her, and Death for her
sake and in her sight a joyous thing.</p>

<p>So used we to dream when we saw those harmonious gestures
and heard that matchless utterance. Then the curtain fell,
and we remembered that it was only a play, and that even
Sarah Bernhardt must “fare as other Empresses,” and “wane
with enforc’d and necessary change.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we give thanks—we that have lived in her day;
for, whatever the future may bring, there will never be another
Sarah Bernhardt:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ROME</span></h2>

<p>I arrived in Rome, after staying a few days on the way
in London and in Florence. In the Drury Lane Pantomime
that year, I think it was <i>Mother Goose</i>, Dan
Leno played a harp solo, which I think is the funniest thing
I ever saw on the stage. He had a subtle, early Victorian,
Byronic way of playing, refined and panic-stricken, and he
played with a keepsake expression, and with sensibility, as
though he might suddenly have the vapours; he became
confused and entangled with the pedals, and at one moment
the harp—and it was a gigantic harp—fell right on to him.</p>

<p>Rome in January was warm; one seldom needed more
than a small wood fire. I had rooms at the Embassy at the
Porta Pia. The Embassy garden is just within the old walls
and is a trap of sun and beauty. The Ambassador was Lord
Currie. Lady Currie, his wife, was Violet Fane, the authoress
of <i>Edwin and Angelina</i>, and of a most amusing novel called
<i>Sophy, or the Adventures of a Savage</i>, as well as of many books
of poems.</p>

<p>The First Secretary was Rennell Rodd. Lord Currie was
not well, but he entertained a great deal.</p>

<p>Shortly after I arrived, Madame Ristori celebrated her
eightieth or her eighty-fifth birthday, and the Ambassador
asked me to write her a letter of congratulation in French. I
did it, and at the end I said that Lord Currie hoped to be able
to send her birthday greetings for many more years to come.
I forget the exact phrase, but I know the words <i>de longues
années</i> occurred, and Lord Currie said to me: “Don’t you
think it is perhaps a little excessive to talk of <i>de longues
années</i> to a lady of eighty?” The expression was slightly
toned down.</p>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Crawshay took me to see Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Ristori. She was a stately old lady with white hair and a
beautiful voice, and I imagine Mrs. Siddons must have been
rather the same kind of person. She talked of D’Annunzio
making a dramatic version of <i>Paolo and Francesca</i>; whether
he had done so then or not, or whether he had only announced
his intention of doing so, I forget. In any case Madame Ristori
disapproved of the idea. She said Dante had said all there
was to say, and then she repeated the six crucial lines from
the <i>Inferno</i> about the <i>disiato riso</i>, and I never heard a more
melodious human utterance.</p>

<p>Talking of some other poetical play, she asked whether it was
a tragedy or not. As we seemed to hesitate, she said: “If it’s
in five acts, it’s a tragedy; if it’s in four acts, it’s a drama.”</p>

<p>The beauty of Rome pierced me like an arrow the first day
I spent there. On my first afternoon I drove to St. Peter’s,
the Coliseum, the Pincio, and the Protestant cemetery, where
Shelley and Keats are buried. I was not disappointed. A few
days later I drove along the Appian Way into the Campagna.
It was a grey day, with a slight silver fringe on the blue hills,
and alone in the desolate majesty of the plain, a shepherd tootled
a melancholy tune on the flute, as sad as the shepherd’s tune in
the third act of <i>Tristan und Isolda</i>. As we drove back, St.
Peter’s shone in a gleam of watery light, and I felt that I had
now seen Rome.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant Embassy to serve at. Diplomatic life
was different at Rome either from life in Paris or Copenhagen.
Society consisted of a number of small and separate circles
that revolved independently of each other, but in which the
members of one circle knew what the members of all the
other circles were doing. The diplomats, and there were a
great number of them, were most of them an integral part of
Roman society, and there were also many literary and artistic
people whose circles formed part of the same system as that of
the Romans and of the diplomatic world.</p>

<p>Lady Currie lived in a world of her own. She seemed to
look on at the rest of the world from a detached and separate
observation post, from which she quietly noted and enjoyed
the doings of others with infinite humour and serious eyes.</p>

<p>She had a quiet, plaintive, half-deprecating way of saying
the slyest and sometimes the most enormous things. She left
it to you to take them or leave them as you chose. One day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in the Embassy garden the servants had surrounded a scorpion
with a ring of fire to see whether, as the legend says, it would
stab itself to death. “Leave the poor salamander alone,” said
Lady Currie; “it’s not its fault that it is a salamander. If it
had its way it might have been an … ambassador.”</p>

<p>To have luncheon or dinner alone with her and Lord Currie
was one of the most enjoyable entertainments in the world,
when she would talk in the most unrestrained manner, and
with gentle flashes of the slyest, the most cunning wit, and a
deliciously funny seemingly careless but carefully chosen
felicity of phrase.</p>

<p>She used to describe her extraordinary childhood and upbringing,
which is depicted in <i>The Adventures of Sophy</i>, and
her early adventures in London; and when she said anything
particularly funny, she looked as if she was quite unconscious
of the meaning of what she had said, as if it had been
an accident. She was fond of poetry and used to read it aloud
beautifully. She was equally fond of her dogs, and she made
splendid use of them as a weapon against bores; by bringing
them into the conversation, making them the subject of mock-serious
and sentimental rhapsodies, dialogues, monologues, and
dramas, and just when the stranger would be thinking, “What
a silly woman this is,” there would be a harmless phrase, perhaps
only one innocent word, which just gave that person a tiny
qualm of doubt as to whether perhaps she was so silly after all.
Once when she was travelling to London at the time the restrictions
against bringing dogs into England were first applied,
she tried to smuggle her dog away without declaring its presence.
The dog was detected, and there was some official who played
a part in this story and in taking away her dog, whom Lady
Currie said she would never forget. Lady Currie had a Turkish
maid who had told her of a Turkish curse which, if spoken at
an open window, had an unpleasant effect on the person against
whom you directed it. She directed the curse against the man
whom she considered to be responsible for depriving her of the
dog. The next morning she was surprised and not a little
startled to read in the <i>Times</i> the death of this public official.
She told me this story in London in 1904.</p>

<p>I went on with my Russian lessons in Rome, and I got
to know a good many Russians, among others M. and Mme
Sazonoff, Princess Bariatinsky, and her two daughters, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
brilliant old lady called Princess Ourousoff, who lived in a
little flat and received almost every evening.</p>

<p>Princess Ourousoff had known Tolstoy and been an intimate
friend of Tourgenev. She was immensely kind to me and
contributed greatly to my education in Russian literature.
She read me poems by Pushkin and introduced me to the prose
and verse of many other Russian authors. Herr Jagow was at
the German Embassy at this time, and he, too, was a friend of
Princess Ourousoff’s. So there were at Rome at this time two
future Ministers of Foreign Affairs, both of whom were destined
to play a part in the war: Herr Jagow and M. Sazonoff.</p>

<p>Among the Italians, my greatest friends were Count and
Countess Pasolini, who had charming rooms in the Palazzo
Sciarra. Count Pasolini was an historian and the author of
a large, serious, and valuable work on Catherina Sforza. His
ways and his conversation reminded me of Hamlet. His
dignity and his high courtesy were mixed with the most impish
humour, and sometimes he would glide from the room like a
ghost, or suddenly expose some curious train of thought quite
unconnected with the conversation that was going on round
him. Sometimes he would be unconscious of the numerous
guests in the room, which was nearly always full of visitors
from every part of Europe; or he would startle a stranger
by asking him what he thought of Countess Pasolini, or, if the
conversation bored him, hum to himself a snatch of Dante.
Sometimes he would be as naughty as a child, especially if he
knew he was expected to be especially good, or he would say
a bitingly ironical thing masked with deference.</p>

<p>One day an Austrian lady came to luncheon who had rather
a strange appearance and still stranger clothes. Her hair was
remarkable for its high lights, her cheeks and eyebrows for their
frank, undisguised artificiality. When the lift porter saw her
he was puzzled. Her costume enhanced the singularity of her
appearance, as she was dressed in pale green, with mermaid-like
effects, and details of shells and seaweed. When she was
ushered into the drawing-room, Pasolini gazed at her with
delighted wonder, concealing his amazement with a veil of
mock admiration, quite sufficiently to hide it from her, but
not well enough to conceal it from those who knew him intimately.
She sat next to him at luncheon, and he was as
charming and deferential as it was possible to be; but those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
who knew him well saw that he was taking a cynical enjoyment
in every moment of the conversation. When she went
away he bowed low, kissed her hand, and said: “Madame, je
tâcherai de vous oublier.”</p>

<p>Count Pasolini sometimes used to remind me of the fantastic,
charming, cultivated, slightly eccentric people that
Anatole France sometimes allows to wander and discourse
through his stories, especially in his early books. Those who
knew him used often to say if only he could meet Anatole
France, and if only Anatole France could meet him. When
the meeting did come off, at a dinner-party, the result was not
quite successful. Count Pasolini knew what was expected of
him, and looking at Anatole France, who was sitting on the
other side of the table, he said to his neighbour in an audible
whisper: “Qui est ce Monsieur un peu chauve?”</p>

<p>One day I took an English lady to tea with him, and he was
so enchanted with her beauty and wit that he said he must have
a souvenir of her, and quite suddenly he cut off a lock of her
hair with a pair of scissors; and this lock he kept in his museum,
and he showed it to me years afterwards. His eyes were remarkable,
they were so thoughtful, so wistful, so deep, so
piercing, and so melancholy; and sometimes you felt he was
not there at all, but on some other plane, pursuing a fantasy, or
chasing a dream or a thought, and all at once he would gently
let you into the secret of his day-dream by a sudden question
or an unexpected quotation. At other times he would join
hotly in the fray of conversation; dispute, argue, pour out
fantastic monologues, and embroider absurd themes.</p>

<p>But whatever he said or did, in whatever mood he was,
whether wistful, combative, naughty, perverse, lyrical, or
fantastic, he never lost his silvery courtesy, his melancholy
dignity. When I said he was like Hamlet, I can imagine him
so well looking at a skull and saying: “Prithee, Horatio,
tell me one thing. Dost think Alexander looked o’ this fashion
i’ the earth?” That is just the kind of remark he would
suddenly make in the middle of a dinner-party. His thoughts
and his dreams flitted about him like dragon-flies, and he sometimes
caught them for you and let you have a fugitive glimpse of
their shining wings.</p>

<p>At Rome I got to know Brewster very well. He lived in
the Palazzo Antici Mattei, and he often gave luncheon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dinner-parties. I often dined with him when he was alone.
His external attitude was one of unruffled serenity and
Olympian impartiality, but I often used to tell him that this
mask of suavity concealed opinions and prejudices as absolute
as those of Dr. Johnson. His opinions and tastes were his own,
and his appreciations were as sensitive as his expression of
them was original. He had the serene, rarefied, smiling melancholy
of great wisdom, without a trace of bitterness. He took
people as they were, and had no wish to change or reform them.
He was catholic in his taste for people, and liked those with
whom he could be comfortable. He was appreciative of the
work of others when he liked it, a discriminating and inspiriting
critic. While I was in Rome, he published his French book,
<i>L’Âme païenne</i>; but his most characteristic book is probably
<i>The Prison</i>. Some day I feel sure that book will be republished,
and perhaps find many readers; it is like a quiet tower hidden
in the side street of a loud city, that few people hear of, and many
pass by without noticing, but which those who visit find to be
a place of peace, haunted by echoes, and looking out on sights
that have a quality and price above and beyond those of the
market-place.</p>

<p>Besides <i>The Prison</i>, Brewster wrote two other books in
English, and a play in French verse, which he had not finished
correcting when he died.</p>

<p>Few people had heard of his books. He used never to
complain of this. He once told me that his work lay in a
narrow and arid groove, that of metaphysical speculation, in
which necessarily but few people were interested. He talked
of it as a narrow strip of stiff ploughland on which just a few
people laboured. He said he would have far preferred a different
soil, and a more fruitful form of labour, but that happened to
be the only work he could do, the soil which had been allotted
him. He was Latin by taste, tradition, and education; a lover
of Rabelais, Montaigne, Ronsard, and Villon, but seventeenth
century French classics bored him. He disputed the idea that
French was necessarily a language which necessitated perspicuity
of expression and clearness of thought. He thought that in
the hands of a poet like Verlaine the French language could
achieve all possible effects of vagueness, of shades of feeling,
of overtones in ideas and in expression. He admired Dante,
Goethe, Byron, and Keats, but not Milton, Wordsworth, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Shelley. He disliked Wagner’s music intensely. It had, he
said, the same effect on him as the noise of a finger rubbed
round the edge of a piece of glass, and he said that he could
gauge from the intensity of his dislike how keen the enjoyment
of those who did enjoy it must be.</p>

<p>In 1906, discussing the revolutionary troubles of Russia, he
said to me: “All Europe seems bent on proving that Liberty
is the tyranny of the rabble. The equation may work itself
out more or less quickly, but it is bound to triumph.” And
again: “As the intelligent are liberals, I am on the side of the
idiots.” And in Rome he often used to say to me that the
fanaticism of free-thinkers and the intolerance of anti-clericals
was to him not only more distasteful than the dogmatism of the
orthodox, but appeared to him to be a more violent and a more
tyrannous thing.</p>

<p>This description (in a letter written in 1903) of how he
discovered Verlaine’s poetry is extremely characteristic:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1870 or ’71 I found in the <i>galeries</i> of the Odéon a
little <i>plaquette</i>—a few rough pages of verse. Nobody that
knew had ever heard of the author, and it was years before I
saw his name mentioned in the Press, or heard him talked of.
But I had stored the name in my memory as that of a great
poet. It was Verlaine… Perhaps Verlaine’s friends told
him that his verse was doubtless pretty, but that he had better
write plays for the <i>Gymnase</i>. Certainly they never made him
rich, and it is a chance, a mere chance, that he did not die
unknown. If he had, it wouldn’t have harmed him. He had
touched his full salary the moment he wrote them. I don’t
believe garlands ever fall on the poet’s head. They collect
round the neck of his ghost which stands in front of him, or
behind. And the ghost bows and smiles or struts, and it is
all so indifferent and so far-off to the other fellow, who sits,
like Verlaine, strumming rhythms on the table of a dirty
little café.”</p>

</div>

<p>He believed in treating Shakespeare’s plays like opera, and
paying the greatest importance to the <i>bravura</i> passages. He
deplored Shakespeare being the victim of pedants and a national
institution. He saw in Shakespeare the Renaissance poet and
nothing else. He thought that any kind of realism was as out
of place in Shakespeare as in the libretto of an opera; that
dramatic poems were not plausible things, nor exhibitions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
real people, and that <i>bravura</i> passages, however absurd their
occurrence in a particular context, looked at from the point
of view of reality, were not only legitimate, but came with
<i>authority</i> if considered as lovely arias, duets, or concerted
pieces.</p>

<p>This view of the production of Shakespeare is now widely
held, though unfortunately it is seldom practised; managers
and players still try to make Shakespeare realistic, and too
often succeed in smothering his plays with scenery, business,
and acting.</p>

<p>The most refreshing thing about Brewster was that he was
altogether without that exaggerated reverence for culture in
general and books in particular that sometimes hampers his
countrymen (he was an American) when they have been transplanted
early into Europe and brought up in France, Italy, or
England, and saturated with art and literature. He liked
books; he enjoyed plays, poetry, and certain kinds of music;
but he didn’t think these things were a matter of life and death.
He enjoyed them as factors in life, an adjunct, an accompaniment,
an interlude, just as he enjoyed a fine day; but he was
never solemn and never pompous, and he knew how much and
how little things mattered. He liked people for what they
were, and not for what they did, or for what they achieved.
The important thing in his eyes was not the quantity of achievement,
or the amount of effort, but the quality of the life lived.
With such ideas he was as detached from the modern world as a
Chinese poet or sage, not from the modern world, but rather
from the world, for to the human beings who lived in it there
never can have been a moment when the world was not
modern, even in the Stone Age; and in the game of life he
strove for no prize; the game itself was to him its own
reward.</p>

<p>In <i>The Prison</i> he writes: “There is a greater reward than
any which the teachers can warrant; they might teach you to
lead a decorous life, help you to learn the rules of the game, show
you how to succeed in it. But the profit of the game itself,
that which makes it worth playing at all, even to those who
succeed best, this they can neither grant nor refuse; you bear
it in yourselves, inalienably, whether you succeed or fail.”</p>

<p>I imagine that a man like Dr. Johnson might have said
severe things about him, and I once heard a critic (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
admired and appreciated him) say it was a pity Brewster was
such an idle and ignorant man. But his ignorance was more
suggestive than the knowledge of others, for he ignored not
what he was unable to learn, but what he had no wish to learn,
and his idleness was a benefit to others as well as to himself:
a fertile oasis in an arid country. His mind had the message
of the flowers that need neither to toil nor to spin.</p>

<p>In February 1902 Pope Leo the Thirteenth celebrated his
jubilee. I heard him officiate at Mass at the Sixtine Chapel,
and I also went—although I forget if this was later or not—to
High Mass at St. Peter’s, when the Pope was carried in on his
chair and blessed the crowd. I had a place under the dome.
At the elevation of the Host the Papal Guard went down on
one knee, and their halberds struck the marble floor with one
sharp, thunderous rap, and presently the silver trumpets rang
out in the dome. At that moment I looked up and my eye
caught the inscription, written in large letters all round it:
“<i>Tu es Petrus</i>,” and I reflected the prophecy had certainly
received a most substantial and concrete fulfilment. Not that
at that time I felt any sympathy with the Catholic Church;
indeed, it might not have existed for me at Rome at that time.
I thought, too, that the English Catholic inhabitants of Rome
were on the look out for converts, and were busy casting their
nets. Of this, however, I saw no trace, although I met several
of them at various times.</p>

<p>But that ceremony in St. Peter’s would have impressed anyone.
And when the Pope was carried through St. Peter’s, with
his cortège of fan-bearers, and rose from his chair and blessed
the crowd with a sweeping, regal, all-embracing gesture, the
solemnity and the majesty of the spectacle were indescribable,
especially as the pallor of the Pope’s face seemed transparent,
as if the veil of flesh between himself and the other world had
been refined and attenuated to the utmost and to an almost
unearthly limit.</p>

<p>During Holy Week I attended some of the ceremonies at St.
Peter’s, and I think what impressed me most was the blessing of
the oils on Maundy Thursday, and the washing of the altar, when
that great church is full of fragrant sacrificial smells of wine
and myrrh, and when the vastness of the crowd suddenly brings
home to you the immense size of the building which the scale
of the ornamentation dwarfs to the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>In May I went to Greece in a yacht belonging to Madame
de Béarn. There were on board besides myself two Austrians
and a German Professor called Krumbacher. We started from
Naples and landed somewhere on the west coast, and went
straight to Olympia. As we landed we were met by a sight
which might have come straight from the Greek anthology: a
fisherman spearing some little silver fishes with a wooden
trident, and wading in the transparent water; and that water
had the colour of a transparent chrysoprase—more transparent
and deeper than a turquoise, brighter and greener than a
chrysoprase. Olympia was carpeted with flowers, and the
fields were like Persian carpets: white and mauve and purple,
with the dark blood-red poppies flung on the bright green corn.
At every turn sights met you that might have been illustrations
to Greek poems: a woman with a spindle; a child with an
amphora on its head. The air was the most iridescent I have
ever seen. At sunset time it was as if it was powdered with
the dust of a million diamonds, and in the background were
the wonderful blue mountains, and against the sky the small
shapes of the trees.</p>

<p>At Olympia, in the museum, the only intact or nearly intact
masterpiece of one of the great Greek sculptors has a little
museum to itself: the Hermes of Praxiteles. There are still
traces, faint traces, of the pink colour on some parts of the limbs,
and even of faded gilding. The marble has the texture and
ripple of live flesh; the statue is different in kind from all the
statues in the Vatican, the Capitol, or the Naples Museum, and
to see it is to have one of those impressions that are like shocks
and take the breath away, and leave one stunned with admiration,
wonder, and awe.</p>

<p>From Olympia we went to tragic heights and rocks of Delphi,
where we saw the bronze statue of the charioteer, so magnificent
in its effect and in its simplicity, and so startling in its trueness
to the coachman type, for the face might be that of a hansom-cab
driver; and from Delphi to Corinth and Athens. The first
sight of the Acropolis and the Parthenon takes the breath away;
the Parthenon is so much larger than one expects it to be; and
the colour of the pillars is not white, but a tawny amber, as though
the marble had been changed to gold. In the evening these
pillars stand like large ghosts against the purple hills, that are
dry, arid, like a volcanic crust. In the distance you see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
blue ocean. And Byron’s lines, with which the “Curse of
Minerva” opens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,</div>
<div class="verse">Along Morea’s hills, the setting sun;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">describe exactly what you see. Byron is by far the most satisfactory
singer of Greece, for he wrote with his eye on the spot,
and there is something in his verse of the exhilarating and incandescent
quality of the Greek air; something of the fiery
strength of the Greek soil, and of the golden warmth of the
Greek marbles.</p>

<p>And next to Byron in this business I should put a widely
different poet, Heredia; but they both seize on the characteristic
things in Greek landscape; Byron, when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yet these proud pillars claim no passing sigh,</div>
<div class="verse">Unmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">perhaps even more than Heredia, when he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Je suis né libre au fond du golfe aux belles lignes,</div>
<div class="verse">Où l’Hybla plein de miel mire ses bleus sommets.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An architect once pointed out to me that one of the most
striking instances of the Greek fastidiousness in matters of art
is to be found in the pavement of the Parthenon, which is not
quite flat, but which is made on a slight curved incline, so that
the effect of perfect flatness to the eye should be complete.
The curve cannot be detected unless the measurements are
taken, showing, as the architect said to me, that the Greeks
aimed at the maximum of effect with the minimum of
advertisement.</p>

<p>While I was at Athens there was a scaffolding on the pediment
of the Parthenon. One could climb up and examine in
detail the marbles spared by Lord Elgin, the wonderful horses
and men which were wrought in the workshop of Pheidias. I
bought photographs of all this part of the frieze, and I used to
have them later in my little house in London, which made my
servant, who had been in the 10th Hussars, remark to a lady
who was doing some typing for me, that there were some very
rum pictures in the house.</p>

<p>From Athens we went to Sunium, the whitest and most
beautifully placed of the temples, and thence to the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
islands—Scyra, Delos, and Paros. The skipper of the yacht,
who was like one of Jacobs’ characters, made an elaborate
plan for taking in Professor Krumbacher, whom he used to call
“Crumb-basket.” We were to go to Rhodes later, and the
skipper, by misleading him on the chart, led him to think the
yacht was arriving at Rhodes when in reality we were arriving
at Candia in Crete. The Professor believed him so absolutely
and greeted the pretended Rhodes with such certainty of
recognition that it was difficult to undeceive him. I had to leave
the expedition at Scyra, to get back to Rome, which I did by
taking a passage in the only available steamer, a small, rickety,
and extremely unreliable-looking craft, like a tin toy-boat.
It was bound for some port not far from the Piræus. It had
no accommodation to speak of, and it was overloaded with
soldiers and with sheep, and both the sheep and the soldiers
were sea-sick without stopping.</p>

<p>It was a rough passage and lasted all night and all the next
morning. I stood on the little bridge the whole time, which
was the only place where there was space to breathe. I was
deposited somewhere on the coast, where the only train had
left for Athens. A tramp steamer called later, which was going
on to the Piræus, and I got a passage in that. I stayed two
more days in Athens by myself. One afternoon while I was at
the Acropolis I met a peasant and had a little talk with him.
I had with me in a little book Sappho’s “Ode to Aphrodite,”
and I asked him to read it aloud, which he did, remarking that
it was in patois.</p>

<p>I went back to Rome by Corfu, where I stopped to see the
Todten-Insel and the complicated classical villa of the German
Emperor.</p>

<p>As the summer progressed, I went for one or two delightful
expeditions in the environs of Rome. One was to Limfa, which
I think is the most magical spot I have ever seen. A deserted
castle rises from a lake, which is entirely filled with water-lilies,
tangled weeds, and green leaves. It was deserted owing
to the malaria that infested it, but it is difficult to imagine it
haunted by anything except fairies or water-nymphs.</p>

<p>In Rome itself I often went for walks with Vernon Lee. She
used to stay with Countess Pasolini, and take me to see out-of-the-way
sights and places rich with peculiar association. I
remember on one walk passing a little low wall by a stream, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
an image of a river god, which she said might have been the
demarcation between two small kingdoms, the kind of limit that
divided the kingdoms of Romulus and Remus; one afternoon
we went to the Pincio, and in the walks and trees of that
enchanted garden we spoke of the past and the future and built
castles in the air, or smoked what Balzac called enchanted
cigarettes, that is to say, talked of the books that never would
be written.</p>

<p>Lord Currie went away before the summer, and Rennell
Rodd was left in charge of the Embassy. I got to know a
quantity of people: Russians, Romans, Americans, Germans,
Austrians; and a stream of foreigners and English people
poured through Rome. I went on taking Russian lessons
and also lessons in modern Greek, and slowly and gradually
I made my first discoveries in Russian literature written in
the Russian language. I read Pushkin’s prose stories aloud,
some of his poems, and Alexis Tolstoy’s poems, and some of
Tourgenev’s prose.</p>

<p>One of the poems that affected me like a landmark and eye-opener
in my literary travels was a poem called <i>Tropar</i> (Tro-parion:
a dirge for the dead), by Alexis Tolstoy. I think even a
bald prose version will give some idea of the majesty of that
poem.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hymn</span></p>

<p>“What delight is there in this life that is not mingled with
earthly sorrow? Whose hopes have not been in vain, and
where among mortals is there one who is happy? Of
all the fruits of our labour and toil, there is nothing that
shall last and nothing that is of any worth. Where is the
earthly glory that shall endure and shall not pass away? All
things are but ashes, and a phantom, shadow and smoke.
Everything shall vanish as the dust of a whirlwind; and face to
face with death, we are defenceless and unarmed; the hand
of the mighty is feeble, and the commands of Kings are as
nothing. Receive, O Lord, Thy departed Servant into Thy
happy dwelling-place.</p>

<p>“Death like a furious knight-at-arms encountered me, and
like a robber he laid me low; the grave opened its jaws and took
away from me all that was alive. Kinsmen and children, save
yourselves, I call to you from the grave. Be saved, my brothers
and my friends, so that you may not behold the flames of Hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Life is the kingdom of vanity, and as we sniff the odour
of death, we wither like flowers. Why do we toss about in
vain? Our thrones are all graves, and our palaces are but
ruins. Receive, O Lord, Thy departed Servant into Thy happy
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>“Amidst the heap of rotting bones, who is king or servant,
or judge or warrior? Who is deserving of the Kingdom of God
and who is the rejected and the evil-doer? O brothers, where
is the gold and the silver, where are the many hosts of servants?
Who is a rich man and who is a poor man? All is ashes and
smoke, and dust and mould, phantom and shadow and dream;
only with Thee in Heaven, O Lord, there is refuge and
safety; that which was flesh shall perish, and our pomp fall in
corruption. Receive, O Lord, Thy departed Servant into Thy
happy dwelling-place.</p>

<p>“And Thou, who dost intercede on behalf of us all, Thou,
the defender of the oppressed, to Thee, most Blessed One, we
cry, on behalf of our brother who lies here. Pray to thy Divine
Son. Pray, O most Pure among Women, for him. Grant that
having lived out his life upon earth, he may leave his affliction
behind him. All things are ashes, dust and smoke and shadow.
O friends, put not your faith in a phantom! When, on some
sudden day, the corruption of death shall breathe upon us,
we shall perish like wheat, cut down by the sickle in the
cornfields. Receive, O Lord, Thy departed Servant into Thy
happy dwelling-place.</p>

<p>“I follow I know not what path; half-hopeful, half-afraid,
I go; my sight is dim, my heart has grown cold, my hearing is
faint, my eyes are closed. I am lying sightless and without
motion, I cannot hear the wailing of the brethren, and the blue
smoke from the censer pours forth for me no fragrance; yet
my love shall not die; and in the name of that love, O my
brothers, I implore you, that each one of you may thus call
upon God: Lord, on that day, when the trumpet shall sound
the end of the world, receive Thy departed Servant, O Lord,
into Thy happy dwelling-place.”</p>

<p>Looking back on that summer in Rome, I shut my eyes now,
and I see the Campagna, with its prodigal wealth of tail grasses
and gay wild flowers; its little sharp asphodels with their
faint smell of garlic; the Villa d’Este, with its overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
terraces, and musical waterfalls, and tangled vegetation—the
home of an invisible slumbering Princess; and Tivoli.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tibur Argæo positum colono</div>
<div class="verse">Sit meæ sedes utinam senectæ</div>
<div class="verse">Sit modus lasso maris et viarum</div>
<div class="verse">Militiæque.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That was the first Ode of Horace I ever read when I was up
to Arthur Benson, in Remove, at Eton. I remember wondering
at the time, what sort of place Tibur was, where Horace,
tired of journeys by land and by sea, and tired of wars and
rumours of war, wished to build himself a final nest.</p>

<p>When I saw Tivoli, with its divinely elegant waterfall, I
understood his wish; nor could I imagine a more enchanting
haven, a more complete and peaceful final goal for the end of
a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>I see the lake of Nemi, where the barges of Tiberius—is it
Tiberius?—still rest beneath the water; and Frascati, and the
view from the roof of a house in the Via—which Via? I forget,
but it was not far from Porta Pia; and from thence, in the red
sunset, you saw St. Peter’s; and I see the view of the whole
city from the Janiculum … more memories here, and older
ones from Macaulay … and the Palatine by moonlight; the
moon streaming on all the thousand fragments, and the few
large plinths of the Forum; and Vernon Lee saying that <i>moonlight
on the Palatine</i> sounded like a stage direction in a play of
Shelley’s; and I see the marbles coloured like some pale seaweed
in Santa Maria in Cosmedìn, and the peep at St. Peter’s,
through the keyhole of one of the College gardens, and the
fountains in the moonlight, on the top of the hill, as you drive
from the station, and the fountain of Trevi into which I threw
a penny, wishing that I might come back to Rome, one day,
but not as a diplomat; and the Milanese shops in the Corso, and
the vast cool spaces of St. Peter’s, on a hot day, when you swung
back the heavy curtain; and the courtyard in Brewster’s
Palace; and then the heat; the great heat when the shutters
were shut, and one stayed indoors all day; and the arrival of an
Indian Prince, whom we met in frock-coats, at six in the morning,
at the railway station, and who turned out not to be a Prince
at all, but a man of inferior caste, and who drank far too much
whisky, and far too little soda, in the Embassy garden, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
became painfully loud and familiar; and at a little tea-party
in my rooms, with Brewster and someone else; a Roman lady,
looking like a Renaissance picture, regal, stately, in a white
fur and tippet; a lady with hosts of adorers, who, when
she saw a book on the Burmese or Buddhism, on my table,
called <i>The Hearts of Men</i>, said with a smile: “That is a
subject, I think, I know something about”; and the Roman
women, no less majestic, but more vociferous, in the Trastevere,
or kneeling with the grace of sculpture before the Pietà in
St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>To look back upon, it is all a wonderful dream-world of
sunshine and flowers and beauty; but at the time, I did not
really like Rome. In spite of the many charming people I met
there, in spite of the associations of the past, and the daily
beauty of the present, I did not enjoy living at Rome as a
diplomat. There was a good deal to do at the Embassy, and
not a large staff, and I only once went for an expedition that
lasted more than one day. Besides which, a diplomat at Rome
was caught in a net of small social duties, visits, days on which
one had to call at the Embassies, cards to be left; one could
not enjoy Rome freely. Besides which, I felt as if I were living
in a cemetery, and I was oppressed by the army of ghosts in
the air, the host of memories, so many crumbling walls and
momentous ruins.</p>

<p>At the end of July, I went to Russia, and spent three weeks
at Sosnofka, where the whole of the Benckendorff family and
one of their cousins were staying. I could now understand
Russian and read it without difficulty, and could talk enough to
get on. I had come to the definite conclusion that I did not
care for Diplomacy as a career. I did not think then, and I
do not think now, that it is worse than any other career. “Il
n’y a pas de sot métier,” and Diplomacy, like anything else,
is what you make it. But unless your heart is in the work,
unless you like it for its own sake, you will never make anything
of it, and I did not like it. I wanted literary work.</p>

<p>My first step was to try and get back to England. I applied
for a temporary exchange into the Foreign Office and got it.
I went back to London in January 1903, and worked in the
Foreign Office, in the Commercial Department, for the rest of
that summer. In the autumn, I went to Russia once more, and
spent most of my time translating a selection of Leonardo da<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Vinci’s <i>Thoughts on Art and Life</i> for the Humanists’ Library,
published by the Merrymount Press, Boston.</p>

<p>I wanted to devote myself to literature; but it was difficult
to find an opening. I had little to show except a book of poems
published in 1902, three articles in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
an article in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and one in the <i>National
Review</i>.</p>

<p>I approached a publisher with the proposal of translating all
Dostoievsky’s novels, or those of Gogol. But he said there would
be no market for such books in England. Dostoievsky had
not yet been discovered, and in one of the leading literary
London newspapers, even as late as 1905, he was spoken of in
a long, serious article, as being a kind of Xavier de Montépin!
Gogol has not yet been discovered, and only one of his books
has been adequately translated.</p>

<p>I cared for the Foreign Office even less than for Diplomacy;
and the only incident of interest I remember was one day when
one of those toy snakes that you squeeze and shut up in a box,
and which expand when released to an enormous size, and hurtle
through the air with a scream, was circulated in the Office in a
red box. Every department was taken in, in turn; and when
it reached my department, I sent it up to the typists’ department,
where it was opened by the head lady typist, a severe lady, who
was so overcome that she at once applied for and received three
weeks’ leave, as well as a letter of abject apology from myself.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to abandon Diplomacy and the Foreign
Office as a career, to go to Russia, to study Russian thoroughly,
and then to make the most of my knowledge later, and to use
it as a means for doing something in literature; but before
doing this, I applied to be put <i>en disponibilité</i> for six months,
and I went back to Russia just after Christmas in 1904.</p>

<p>Count Benckendorff had been appointed Ambassador to
London and had taken up his duties in January, 1903. All
through the autumn of 1903, the political situation in the Far
East had given rise to anxiety. Russia and Japan seemed to
be drifting into war. The Russian Government apparently did
not want to go to war, but nobody in it had a definite policy;
and the strings were being pulled by various incompetent
adventurers in the Far East. The Japanese took advantage
of this and brought matters to a head.</p>

<p>Before I went to Russia, I saw Lord Currie and Lady Currie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
for the last time in London. Lord Currie had given up
Diplomacy. He did not believe there would be war, nor did
many people at the Foreign Office, but they based their belief
on what they thought were the wishes of the Russian Government.
They knew nothing of the more definite intentions of
the Japanese, nor of the irresponsible factors among the Russians
in the Far East.</p>

<p>I arrived at St. Petersburg just after Christmas.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">RUSSIA AND MANCHURIA</span></h2>

<p>When I arrived at St. Petersburg, the situation was
regarded as grave, but people still did not believe
in war. Sir Charles Scott, our Ambassador, had
just left, or was just leaving; and Cecil Spring Rice was in charge
at the Embassy. The large Court functions which were held
at the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg, just after Christmas,
were to take place: the Court concert and the State ball. The
concert was held, and Chaliapine sang at it, but the State ball
was put off. And never again was a State ball given in St.
Petersburg. I had never seen St. Petersburg before. I was
staying in the Fontanka, at Countess Shuvaloff’s house, and I
was delighted by the crystal atmosphere, and the drives in
open carriages; there was a little snow on the ground, but not
enough for sledging.</p>

<p>People said there would be no war, and then we woke up one
morning and heard the Japanese had attacked the Russian
fleet at Port Arthur, and torpedoed the <i>Retvizan</i>. Constantine
Benckendorff, Count Benckendorff’s eldest son, was on board
the <i>Retvizan</i> when this happened; and I was told afterwards,
that no orders had been given by the port authorities, that is
to say, by Alexeieff, the Viceroy, to put out torpedo-nets, or to
take any precautions, although the Viceroy had been warned
that day of the probability of an attack. The morning we
heard that war had been declared I remember seeing a cabman
driving by himself down the quays and nodding his head and
repeating to himself: “War! war!” (“<i>Voinà! voinà!</i>”).
It was like, on a smaller scale, the days of August 1914. The
crowds in the street were enthusiastic. Officers were carried
in triumph in the streets by the students, the same officers
that a year later were hooted and stoned in the same streets.</p>

<p>I only stayed a short time in St. Petersburg, and then I went
to Moscow, to the house of Marie Karlovna von Kotz, a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
who took in English pupils, mostly officers in the British Army,
to teach them Russian. She lived in an out-of-the-way street,
on the second story of a small house, and gave one or two lessons
every day. She was a fine teacher, and a brilliant musician;
an energetic and extremely competent woman, and an example
of the best type of the <i>intelligentsia</i>.</p>

<p>One day, a friend of hers, a young married lady, came in and
said she was starting for the Far East, as a hospital nurse. She
seemed to be full of enthusiasm. She was a young and charming
person, bristling with energy and intelligence. The sequel of
this story was a strange one. A year later, she reappeared at
Marie Karlovna’s house—I think she had been to the war in
the meantime—and said: “I am now going to the Far West,”
and she went to Paris. She stayed there a short time, and then
came back to Moscow and went to the play every night, bought
jewels, went to hear the gipsies, and then quite suddenly shot
herself on Tchekov’s tomb. The explanation of her act being
her disgust with public events and her wish to give her
land to the peasants. She left her estate to them in her will.
In the normal course of things it would go to her brother, but
her brother was a fanatical reactionary, and she killed herself
rather than he should have it. But, as it turned out, she had
reckoned without Russian law, which said that the wills and
bequests of those who committed suicide in Russia were null
and void, and so the property went to her brother after all.
Suicides at the tomb of Tchekov became so frequent that a
barrier was put round it, and people were forbidden to visit it.</p>

<p>There were one or more other pupils living in Marie Karlovna’s
house besides the English Consul, who used to board
there. We used to have dinner at two o’clock in the afternoon,
and a late supper, ending in tea, which used to go on till far
into the night. It was there I made my first acquaintance
with the peculiar comfortless comfort of Russian life among
the <i>intelligentsia</i>. Nothing could seemingly and theoretically
be more uncomfortable; the hours irregular; no door to any
room ever being shut; no fireplaces, only a stove lit once every
twenty-four hours; visitors drifting in, and sitting and talking
for hours; but nothing in practice was more comfortable. There
was an indescribable ease about the life, a complete absence of
fuss, a fluid intimacy without any of the formalities, any of the
small conventions and minute ritual that distinguish German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
bourgeois life and, indeed, are a part of its charm. In Russia,
everybody seemed to take everybody and everything for granted.
There were no barriers, no rules, no obstacles. No explanations
were ever thought necessary or were either ever asked for or
given. Time, too, had no meaning. One long conversation
succeeded another, into which different people drifted, and
from which people departed without anyone asking why or
whence or whither. Moscow in winter was a comfortable city.
The snow was deep; sometimes in the evening we would go to
the <i>montagnes Russes</i> and toboggan down a steep chute, and
more often I would go to the play.</p>

<p>At that time the Art Theatre at Moscow, the <i>Hudozhestvenii
Teater</i>, was at the height of its glory and of its excellence. This
theatre had been started about four years previously by a
company of well-to-do amateurs under the direction of M. Stanislavsky.
I believe, although I am not quite sure, they began
by acting <i>The Mikado</i> for fun, continued acting for pleasure,
and determined to spare neither trouble nor expense in making
their performances as perfect as possible. They took a theatre,
and gave performances almost for nothing, but the success of
these performances was so great, the public so affluent, that
they were obliged to take a new theatre and charge high prices.
Gradually the Art Theatre became a public institution. In
1904 they possessed the best all-round theatre in Russia, if not
in Europe.</p>

<p>The rise of such a theatre in Russia was not the same thing
as that of an Art Theatre would be in London. For in Moscow
and St. Petersburg there were large State-paid theatres where
ancient and modern drama was performed by highly trained
and excellent artists; but it stood in relation to these theatres as
the Théâtre Antoine to the Comédie Française, the Vaudeville,
and the Gymnase in Paris: with this difference, that the acting,
though equally finished, was more natural, and the quality of
the plays performed unique on the European stage. The Art
Theatre made the reputation of Tchekov as a dramatist. His
first serious play, <i>Ivanov</i>, was performed at one of the minor
theatres at Moscow, and we can read in his letters what he
thought of that performance. Another of his important plays,
<i>The Seagull</i> (<i>Chaika</i>), was performed at one of the big State-paid
theatres at St. Petersburg, and well performed, but on conventional
lines. It is not surprising the play failed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
this same play was performed by the Art Theatre at Moscow,
it was triumphantly and instantly successful. The reason is
that Tchekov’s plays demand a peculiar treatment on the stage
to make their subtle points tell, and cross the footlights. In
them the clash of events is subservient to the human figure;
and the human figure itself to the atmosphere in which it is
plunged. Later, I saw <i>The Seagull</i> played at a State theatre at
St. Petersburg, long after Tchekov’s reputation was firmly established.
It was well played, but the effect of the play was ruined,
or rather non-existent. In London, I saw <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>
and another play of his done, where the company had not even
realised the meaning of the action, besides being costumed in
the most grotesquely impossible clothes, as grotesque and impossible
as it would be to put on the English stage a member
of Parliament returning from the House of Commons in a kilt,
or dressed as a harlequin. One of the most dramatic situations
in one of these plays had simply escaped the notice of the producer,
and was allowed not only to fall flat, but was not rendered
at all. It was this: a man, who has been wounded in the head
and has a bandage, has a quarrel with his mother, and in a
passion of rage, he tears his bandage from his head, with the
object of reopening his wound, and killing himself. The company
had, I suppose, read the stage direction, which says: “Man
removes bandage,” and the words of the scene were spoken
without any emotion or emphasis, and at one moment, the man
quietly removed his bandage, and dropped it on the floor, as
though it were in the way, or as if he were throwing down a
cigarette which he has done with.</p>

<p>In Moscow, in the Art Theatre, every effect was made to
tell, and the acting was so natural that on one occasion I
remember a man in the stage-box joining in the conversation
and contradicting one of the actors. Although the ensemble
of the troupe was superlative, they had no actor or actress of
outstanding genius, no Duse, no Sarah Bernhardt, no Irving,
no Chaliapine; on the other hand, there was not one small part
which was not more than adequately played.</p>

<p>In 1904, they had just produced <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> by
Tchekov, and soon afterwards, Tchekov died. That winter, I
saw <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> and <i>Uncle Vania</i>, Shakespeare’s <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>, and Hauptmann’s <i>Lonely Lives</i>.</p>

<p>The end of <i>Uncle Vania</i> was unforgettable. The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and action of that play can be summed up in a few words. The
play is called <i>Scenes from Country Life</i>. A professor, not unlike
Casaubon, in <i>Middlemarch</i>, marries a young and beautiful wife.
His estate is managed by his first wife’s brother, Uncle Vania,
assisted by his niece, a good girl ill-favoured in looks. Astroff,
a doctor, is called in to minister to the professor. Uncle Vania
is in love with the professor’s wife. His niece, Sonia, is in love
with Astroff. The professor’s wife, a non-moral, well-meaning
Circe, is interested, but not more than interested, in the doctor,
and flirts with him enough to prevent his marrying the girl.
The nerves of these various characters, under the stress of the
situation, are worked up to such a pitch, that Uncle Vania actually
tries to kill the professor, and shoots at him twice, but misses
him. Then the professor and his wife go away; the doctor
goes back to his practice, and Uncle Vania and his niece are
left behind to resume the tenor of their way. You see the
good-byes: a half-passionate, half-cynical good-bye, between
the professor’s wife and the doctor—the professor says good-bye
to Uncle Vania, and to Uncle Vania’s old mother. You hear
the bells of the horses outside, in the autumn evening. One
after another, Uncle Vania’s mother, his niece, and the old
servant of the house come in and say: “They have gone!”</p>

<p>When I first saw the play, this is what I wrote about it, and
I have nothing to add, nor could I put it differently:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Described, this appears insignificant; seen, acted as it
is with incomparable naturalness, it is indescribably effective.
In this scene a particular mood, which we have all felt, is captured
and rendered; a certain chord is struck which exists in
all of us; that kind of ‘toothache at heart’ which we feel
when a sudden parting takes place and we are left behind.
The parting need not necessarily be a sad one. But the tenor
of our life is interrupted. As a rule the leaves of life are turned
over so quickly and noiselessly by Time that we are not aware
of the process. In the case of a sudden parting we hear the
leaf of life turn over and fall back into the great blurred book
of the past—read, finished, and irrevocable. It is this hearing
of the turning leaf which Tchekov has rendered merely by three
people coming into a room one after another and saying:
‘They’ve gone!’</p>

<p>“The intonation with which the old servant said: ‘They’ve
gone’—an intonation of peculiar cheerfulness with which
servants love to underline what is melancholy—was marvellous.
The lamp is brought in. Lastly the doctor goes. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
mother reads a magazine by the lamplight; the clatter of the
horses’ hoofs and the jingling of bells are heard dying away in
the distance; and Uncle Vania and his niece set to work at
their accounts … you hear the abacus—always used in
Russian banks—making a clicking noise … and the infinite
monotony of their life begins once more.”</p>

</div>

<p>The first performances of <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> were equally
impressive. I saw it acted many times later, but nothing
touched the perfection of its original cast. <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>
is the most symbolic play ever written. It summed up the
whole of pre-revolutionary Russia. The charming, feckless
class of landowners; the pushing, common, self-made man,
who with his millions buys the estate with the cherry orchard
that the owners have at last to sell, because they cannot consent
to let it to cut their losses; the careless student; the
grotesque governess; all of them dancing on the top of a volcano
which is heaving and already rumbling with the faint noise of
the coming convulsion. The Russo-Japanese War and its
consequences were the beginning of these convulsions; and, as
Count Benckendorff prophesied to me in 1903, as soon as war
came to Russia, there was a revolution.</p>

<p>Pierre Benckendorff, Count Benckendorff’s second son, who
was an officer in the Gardes-à-cheval, started for Manchuria
soon after the war began. He exchanged into a Cossack regiment
for the purpose, as the Guards did not go to the front.
He looked so radiantly young and adventurous, when he started,
that we were all of us afraid he would never come back. He
passed through Moscow on his way to the front, and I spent
the day with him. He asked me why I did not try to go to the
war as a newspaper correspondent, as I could speak Russian,
and his father would be able to give me letters of recommendation
to the military authorities. His words sank deep, and I
determined to try and do this. I at once wrote to his father.</p>

<p>Count Benckendorff thought the idea was an excellent one;
and just before Easter I went to London to try and get a newspaper
to send me out. I went to the <i>Morning Post</i>, where I
knew Oliver Borthwick, the son of the proprietor, Lord Glenesk.
At first the matter seemed to be fraught with every kind of
difficulty, but in the end things were arranged, and towards the
end of April I started for St. Petersburg, on my way to Manchuria,
laden with a saddle, a bridle, a camp bed, and innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cooking utensils. I knew nothing about journalism, and
still less about war, and I felt exactly as if I were going back to
a private school again.</p>

<p>I stopped two nights in St. Petersburg, and engaged a
Russian servant. He was a gigantic creature, who had served
in a cavalry regiment of the Guards. At Moscow, I met Brooke,
who was going out as correspondent for Reuter, and we settled
to travel together.</p>

<p>The journey was not uneventful. As far as Irkutsk, we
travelled in the ordinary express train, which had comfortable
first-and second-class carriages, a dining-room, a pianoforte,
a bathroom, and a small bookcase full of Russian books. The
journey from Moscow to Irkutsk lasted nine nights and eight
days. Guy Brooke and I shared a first-class compartment. I
made friends with the official who looked after the train, and
gave him my pocket-knife; and he undertook to post a letter for
me when he got back to Moscow. He kept his promise, and my
first dispatch to the <i>Morning Post</i>, the first dispatch from our
batch of correspondents, got through without being censored.
There was not much war news in it. In fact, it contained a
long and detailed account of a performance of Tchekov’s <i>Uncle
Vania</i> at the Art Theatre at Moscow.</p>

<p>On board the train, there was a French correspondent,
M. Georges La Salle, and a Danish Naval Attaché, and another
English correspondent, Hamilton; several Russian officers,
and a Russian man of business, who lived at Vladivostok.
This man gave us a good deal of trouble; he thought we were
English spies, and told us we would never be allowed to reach
our destination. He did his best to prevent our doing so. He
told the officers we were spies, and their manner, which at first
had been friendly, underwent a change, and became at first
suspicious, and finally openly hostile. The passenger trains
ran from Irkutsk to Baikal Station, and it was at Baikal that
the real interest of the journey began. Lake Baikal was frozen,
and was crossed daily by two large ice-breakers, which ploughed
through three feet of half-melted ice. The passage lasted four
hours. The spectacle when we started was marvellous. It
had been a glorious day. The sun in the pure frozen sky was
like a fiery, red, Arctic ball. Before us stretched an immense
sheet of ice, powdered with snow and spotless, except for a long
brown track which had been made by the sledges. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
far-off horizon a low range of mountains disappeared in a veil of
snow made by the low-hanging clouds. The mountains were
intensely blue; they glinted like gems in the cold air, and we
seemed to be making for some mysterious island, some miraculous
reef of sapphires. Towards the west there was another and
more distant range, where the intense deep blue faded into a
delicate and transparent sea-green—the colour of the seas
round the Greek Islands—and these hills were like a phantom
continuation of the larger range, as unearthly and filmy as a
mirage.</p>

<p>As we moved, the steamer ploughed the ice into flakes,
which leapt and were scattered into fantastic, spiral shapes, and
flowers of ice and snow. As the sun sank lower, the strangeness
and the beauty increased. A pink halo crept over the
sky round the sun, which became more fiery and metallic. Some
lines from Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner” came into my head
which exactly fitted the scene:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And now there came both mist and snow</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And it grew wondrous cold:</div>
<div class="verse">And ice, mast-high, came floating by</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As green as emerald.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the sun set the whole sky became pink, and the distant
mountains were like ghostly caverns of ice.</p>

<p>We arrived at eight. It was dark, and the other ice-breaker
was starting on its return journey to the sound of military
music.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock we resumed our journey. The train
was so full that it was impossible not only to get a seat in the
first-or second-class, but at first it seemed doubtful whether we
should obtain a place of any kind in the train. I jumped into
a third-class carriage, which was at once invaded by a crowd of
<i>muzhik</i> women and children. An official screamed ineffectually
that the carriage was reserved for the military; upon which
an angry <i>muzhik</i>, waving a huge loaf of bread (like an enormous
truncheon), cried out, pointing to the seething, heterogeneous
crowd: “Are we not military also—one and all of us
reservists?” And they refused to move.</p>

<p>The confusion was incredible, and one man, by the vehement
way in which he flung himself and his property on his wooden
seat, broke it, and fell with a crash to the ground. The third-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
carriages were formed in this way: the carriage was not
divided into separate compartments, but was like a corridor
carriage, with no partition and no doors between the carriage
proper and the corridor. It was divided into three sections,
each section consisting of six plank beds, three on each side
of the window, and one placed above the other, forming three
stories. There was besides this one tier of seats against and
over the windows in the passage at right-angles to the regular
seats. The occupant of each place had a right to the whole
length of the seat, so that he could lie down at full length. I
gave up my seat in the first carriage, as I had lost sight of my
luggage and my servant, and I went in search of the guard.
The guard found places for Brooke and myself in a carriage
occupied mostly by soldiers. He told them to make room for
us. It seemed difficult, but it was done. I was encamped on
a plank at the top of the corridor part of the carriage. I remember
being awakened the next morning by a scuffle. A
party of Chinese coolies had invaded the train. They were
drunk and they slobbered. The soldiers shouted: “Get out,
Chinese.” They were bundled backwards and forwards, and
rolled on to the platform outside the train, where they were
allowed to settle. It was now, in this railway carriage, that I
for the first time came into intimate contact with the Russian
people, for in a third-class railway carriage the artificial barriers
of life are broken down, and everyone treats everyone else
as an equal. I was immensely interested. The soldiers began
to get up. One of them, dressed in a scarlet shirt, stood against
the window and said his prayers to the rising sun, crossing
himself many times. A little later a stowaway arrived; he
had no ticket, and the under-guard advised him to get under the
seat during the visit of the ticket collector. This he did, and
he stayed there until the visit of the ticket collector was over,
and whenever a new visit was threatened, he hid again.</p>

<p>After the first day, I was offered a seat on the ground floor
in the central division of the carriage, because I had a bad
foot, and the fact was noticed. My immediate neighbours
were Little Russians. They asked many questions: whether the
English were orthodox; the price of food and live stock; the
rate of wages in England; and they discussed foreign countries
and foreign languages in general. One of them said French
was the most difficult language, and Russian the easiest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
French were a clever people. “As clever as you?” I asked.
“No,” they answered; “but when we say clever we mean <i>nice</i>.”</p>

<p>I gradually made the acquaintance of all the occupants of
the compartment. They divided the day into what they called
“occupation” and “relaxation.” Occupation meant doing
something definite like reading or making a musical instrument—one
man was making a violin—relaxation meant playing
cards, doing card tricks, telling stories, or singing songs. In the
evening a bearded soldier, a native of Tomsk, asked me to
write down my name on a piece of paper, as he wished to mention
in a letter home that he had seen an Englishman. He had
never seen one before, but sailors had told him that Englishmen
were easy to get on with, and clean—much cleaner than
Russians. He told me his story, which was an extremely
melancholy one. He had fallen asleep on sentry-go and had
served a term of imprisonment, and had been deprived of civil
rights. For the first time I came across the aching sadness one
sometimes met with among Russians, an unutterable despair,
a desperate, mute anguish. The conversation ended with an
exchange of stories among the soldiers. One of them told me a
story about a priest. He wondered whether I knew what a
priest meant, and to make it plain he said: “A priest, you
know, is a man who always lies.”</p>

<p>I asked the bearded man if he knew any stories. He at
once sat down and began a fairy-tale called <i>The Merchant’s Son</i>.
It took an hour and a half in the telling. Very often the men
who in Russia told such stories could neither read nor write,
but this man could read, though he had never read the story
he told me in a book. It had been handed down to him by his
parents, and to them by his grandparents, and so on, word for
word, with no changes. This is probably how the <i>Iliad</i> was
handed down to one generation after another. Later on I was
told stories like this one by men who could neither read nor
write. The story was full of dialogue and reiteration, and
every character in it had its own epithet which recurred throughout
the story, every time the character was mentioned, just as
in Homer. When he had finished his story, he began another
called <i>Ivan the Little Fool</i>. It began in this kind of way:
“Once upon a time in a certain country, in a certain kingdom,
there lived a King and a Queen, who had three sons, all braver
and brighter than pen can write or story can tell, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
third was called Ivan the Fool. The King spoke to them thus:
‘Take each of you an arrow, pull your bow-string taut, and shoot
in different directions, and where the arrow falls there shall you
find a wife.’ The eldest brother shot an arrow, and it fell on
a palace just opposite the King’s daughters’ quarters; and the
second son shot an arrow, and it fell opposite the red gate of the
house where lived the lovely merchant’s daughter; and the third
brother shot an arrow, and it fell in a muddy swamp and a frog
caught it. And Ivan said: ‘How can I marry a frog? She
is too small for me.’ And the King said to him: ‘Take her.’”
And then the story went on for a long time, and in it Ivan the
Fool was, of course, far more successful than his two elder
brothers. Another soldier told me a version of the story of
King John and the Abbot of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The ballad says that King John asked the Abbot three
questions. The first one was how much he was worth; the
second one how soon he could ride round the world; and the
third question the Abbot had to answer was, what the King was
thinking of. And the Abbot answered the third question by
saying: “You think I’m the Abbot of Canterbury, but I am
really only his shepherd in disguise.” The soldier told it in
exactly the same way, except that the Abbot became a
Patriarch, and King John the Tsar of Moscow, and the shepherd
a miller. And when he had finished, he said: “The miller lives
at Moscow and I have seen him.”</p>

<p>The soldiers spoke little of the war. One of them said
the Japanese were a savage race, upon which the sailor who had
been to Nagasaki, cut him short by saying: “They are a
charming, clean people, much more cultivated than you or I.”
One of the soldiers said it would have been a more sensible
arrangement if the dispute had been settled by a single combat
between Marquis Ito and Count Lamsdorff.</p>

<p>The night before we arrived at Manchuria station the
passengers sang songs. Four singers sang some magnificent
folk-songs, and among others the song of the Siberian exiles:
“Glorious Sea of Holy Baikal,” one singing the melody and
the others joining in by repeating or imitating it. But the song
which was the most popular was a ballad sung by a sailor,
who was taking part in the concert. He had composed it
himself. It was quite modern in tune and intensely sentimental.
It was about a fallen maiden, who had left the palaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of the rich and died in hospital. It was exactly like the kind
of song I heard bluejackets sing on board an English man-of-war
years later. At Manchuria station we had a lot of bother
owing to the commercial gentleman, and I annoyed him greatly
by talking in front of him to a Greek merchant, who was at the
buffet, in Greek—a language with which he was imperfectly
acquainted. The commercial gentleman tried to prevent us
going farther, but he did not succeed, as our papers were in
perfect order. But he succeeded in having us put under arrest,
and two Cossacks were told to keep watch over us during the
remainder of the journey. In the meantime the officers had
telegraphed for information about us to Kharbin, and the next
morning they received a satisfactory answer, and their whole
demeanour changed. From Manchuria station to Kharbin the
journey lasted three days and two nights, and we arrived at
Kharbin after a journey of seventeen days from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>I have forgotten the latter part of that journey, but I recorded
at the time that a crowd of Chinese officers boarded the
train at one station and filled up the spare seats, especially
top seats, whence they spat without ceasing on the occupants
of the lower seats, much to the annoyance of a French lady,
who said: “Les Chinois sont impossibles.”</p>

<p>Kharbin was a large, straggling place, part of which consisted
of a Chinese quarter, an “Old” Russian quarter which
was like a slice of a small Russian provincial town, and a modern
quarter: Government Offices, an hotel, restaurants, a church,
and the Russo-Chinese bank.</p>

<p>The sight of Kharbin when I arrived—the mud, the absence
of vehicles, the squalor, the railway station, a huge <i>art nouveau</i>
edifice, the long vistas of muddy roads or swampy trails, the
absence of any traces of civilisation, and then the hotel, which
was dearer than any hotel I have ever stayed at before or
since, with its damp, dirty room and suspicious bedstead, and
its convict squinting waiters still redolent of jail life, and its
millions of flies—filled me with despair. At the beginning of
the war Kharbin was the centre of everything that was undesirable
in the Russian army and in the civilian populations of the
whole world. Later on, Kuropatkin forbade officers to go there
except under special circumstances. When we arrived, there
were a certain number of officers on their way to the front,
and of officers who had escaped from the front for a few days’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
leave. The restaurants were full of noisy, shouting crowds,
and nondescript ladies in cheap finery, about which everything
was doubtful except their profession.</p>

<p>There were a number of Greek traders in the town; and
wherever there is a war, in whatever part of the world, Greek
traders seem to rise from the ground as if by magic, with
sponges and other necessaries, for sale. At Harbin, there
was also a local population of engineers and soldiers, who had
jobs there, but these I only got to know a year later. I made
the acquaintance of Colonel Potapoff at Kharbin. He was one
of the press censors who had to look after the correspondents.
He had been to South Africa. We became friends with him at
once, and I saw him frequently during the next ten years.</p>

<p>I only stayed a week at Kharbin. I travelled to Mukden
in great luxury in a first-class carriage reserved by General
Kholodovsky. The General entertained me like a prince. He
was extremely cultivated, courteous, and well read; a collector
of china; an admirer of Tolstoy; a big game shooter. I stayed
in his carriage a week after we had arrived at Mukden.</p>

<p>At Mukden we were plunged in China proper. It was as
Chinese, so I was told, as Pekin—even more Chinese. The town
was a long way from the station, and one drove to it in a rickshaw
pulled along by a Chinese coolie. The drive took nearly
an hour. But I made this interesting discovery, that if everyone
goes by rickshaw it is just the same as if everyone travels by
motor-car. You are not conscious of life being slower. The
day after I arrived, I called at a house where some of the other
war correspondents were living. There was Charles Hands of
the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and there I made the acquaintance of M. de
Jessen, a Danish correspondent. At the station I had already
been met and welcomed by Whigham, who was also correspondent
for the <i>Morning Post</i>. He had rooms in Mukden, and he
asked me to come and share them. I did so. I moved into the
town, and arrived at the Der-Lung-Den (the Inn of the Dragon),
a large courtyard surrounded by a series of rooms that had no
second story. I was shown one of these rooms and was told
it could be mine. It seemed suitable, but it had no floor
but earth, and no paper on the walls; in fact, it was not more
like a room than the stall of a stable. But the Chinese hotel-keeper
said that would be all right. An architect, a builder,
and an upholsterer were sent for, and that very day the stall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
was converted into a comfortable and elegant bedroom, with a
floor carpeted with matting and an elegant wall-paper, and was
ready for use. Apparently the Chinese did not make a room
inhabitable in an hotel until they knew someone was going to
inhabit it. The next thing was to get a servant. I had brought
a servant from Russia, but he had complained of the hard work.
In fact, he had said he was not used to work at all. As he had
been a trooper in a cavalry regiment this seemed a little strange,
but he explained that the work had always been done for him.
He was not one of the World’s Workers. He showed signs of
grumbling, but Colonel Potapoff made short work of his grievance
and packed him off home by the next train. I engaged a
Chinese servant, called Afoo, who came from southern China.</p>

<p>The next thing was to buy a pony and engage a groom, a
Mafoo. When it became known I wanted a pony, the whole
yard seemed to swarm with ponies. I bought one with the
assistance of the hotel-keeper. It seemed to be a fairly amenable
animal, but the Mafoo, whom I engaged afterwards, at once
pointed out to me that it was almost blind in one eye. I soon
made the acquaintance of all the other correspondents: Ludovic
Naudeau, who was writing for the <i>Journal</i>; Recouly, who was
writing for the <i>Temps</i>; Archibald, who was photographing for
I don’t know how many American newspapers; Millard, who
wrote for the <i>New York World</i>; Simpson, who was the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> correspondent; Colonel Gaedke, the representative
of the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, and Premier Lieutenant von Schwartz,
who wrote for the <i>Lokal Anzeiger</i>.</p>

<p>M. de Jessen has written a chapter of sketches on all these
characters, and the life we lived at Mukden, in a book called
<i>Men I Have Met</i>, published in Copenhagen in 1909. The best
writer of all these was probably Ludovic Naudeau. Charles
Hands could have rivalled him, but he wisely never, or hardly
ever, put pen to paper.</p>

<p>Colonel Gaedke stood aloof in his military technical knowledge.
He was stiff in opinions, and, as it happened, always in
the wrong. He was one of those people who are wrong from
the right reasons. He saw at once that people talked nonsense
about the Russian Army, and this led him rashly to prophesy
they would win the war. He was indignant with the strategy
of the higher command. He used to arrive in a great state of
excitement and say: “Kuropatkin has again made a mistake.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
And on one occasion he told me that if the Russian Generals
went on waging war in such a fashion, he would go home, he
simply could not look on at so many glaring errors in tactics
and strategy.</p>

<p>Of the correspondents the most extraordinary character was
Archibald. He wore about four rows of medals on his tunic. In
fact, he went to war to collect medals, and he had been with the
Boers and with the English during the South African War. He
was the despair of the press censors. He wanted to go home
after he had been at Mukden a certain time and had taken a
number of photographs; but he wanted to go home <i>via</i> Japan
and not across the Trans-Siberian railway. This correspondents
had promised not to do, but Archibald had determined to do it.
He took one of the press censors with him to Pekin, and arranged
for his party to be kidnapped and subsequently rescued. When
he came back, he used the adventure as a lever, and obtained
the permission he wished. His imagination was unlimited, and
his power of statement unrivalled. When he came back from
Pekin he said he had interviewed the Emperor of China and the
Empress, and he had been made a Mandarin of the highest
class. During the European War, I believe he got into trouble
by bringing Austrian papers into England.</p>

<p>M. de Jessen was the most amiable of Danes, a shrewd
observer and a vivid writer. But the most interesting of all
the correspondents I knew was a Russian I met later, called
Nicholas Popoff, who was destined to be one of the pioneers of
flying in Russia, and one of the first pilots to accomplish daring
feats in the air. Alas! he paid for his temerity with a bad
crash, which disabled him for life.</p>

<p>We led a restless but amusing life. Everyone wanted to
go to the front, and nobody was allowed to go.</p>

<p>Mukden would have been an ideal spot to spend the summer
in, if there had been no war going on. The climate was warm;
the air fresh; the place full of colour, variety, and interest.
Mukden is a large, square town surrounded by a huge, thick,
dilapidated, and mouldering wall, on the top of which you can
go for a long walk. Inside the wall, the closely packed one-storied
houses are intersected by two or three main streets and
innumerable small alleys. The shops in the main streets are gay
and splendid with sign-boards: huge blue-and-red boots covered
with gold stars hang in front of the bootmakers; golden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
many coloured shields and banners hang in front of other shops;
gongs clang outside the theatres to attract the passers-by;
every now and then a Mandarin rides by, gorgeous in navy
blue and canary-coloured satin, on a white fast-trotting
pony, and behind him, at a respectful distance, his servant
follows him on a less elegant piece of horse-flesh; or large
carts lumber along with prehistoric wheels, and with the
curtains of their closed hoods drawn, probably conveying
some Chinese ladies. Add to all this, sunshine and the smell
of life and brilliant colour. There is nothing modern in the
town. It is the same as it was a thousand years ago, and at
Mukden you could live the same life as a contemporary of Julius
Cæsar lived. One of the most curious features of Mukden is
the palace. It is deserted, but it still contains a collection of
priceless art treasures, jewels, china, embroidery, and illuminated
MSS. These treasures are locked up in mouldering cupboards.
Its courtyards are carpeted with luxuriant grass, its fantastic
dilapidated wooden walls are carven, painted, and twisted into
strange shapes such as you see on an Oriental vase. The planks
are rotten, the walls eaten with rain and damp, and one thanks
Heaven that it is so, and that nothing has been restored.</p>

<p>In Mukden no house had more than one story, and the
houses of the well-to-do were divided into quadrangles like
an Oxford College. Life at Mukden, without the complicated
machinery of European modern life, without any of the appliances
that are devised for comfort and which so often are engines
of unrest, had all the comforts one could wish. There were no
bathrooms; on the other hand, if you wanted a hot bath, a
Chinaman would bring you an enormous tub, long and broad
enough to lie down in, and fill it with boiling water from kettles.
There was no question of the bath being tepid because something
had gone wrong with the pipes or the tap.</p>

<p>Mukden reminded me of a Chinese fairy-tale by Hans Andersen.
The buildings, the shops, the temples, the itinerant
pedlars, the sounding gongs, the grotesque signs seemed to
belong to the realm of childish trolldom or to some great pantomime.
It was in the place of Mukden, one felt, that the
Emperor of China, whom Andersen tells of, sat and sighed for
the song of the nightingale, when his artificial metallic singing
bird suddenly snapped and ceased to sing. Still more enchanting
in the same way were the tombs of Pai-Ling and Fu-Ling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Here the delicate and gorgeous-coloured buildings, red as
lacquer and curious in design, which protect the remains of the
Manchurian dynasty, are approached by wild wood-ways, paths
of soft grass, and alleys of aromatic and slumber-scented trees.</p>

<p>The high, quaint towers and ramparts which surround the
tombs are half dilapidated, the colours are faded, the staircases
rotten and overgrown with moss and grass, and no profane hand
is allowed to restore or repair them.</p>

<p>While I was at Mukden I had an interview with the Chinese
Viceroy, and one day I was invited to luncheon at the Chinese
Foreign Office. The meal was semi-European. It began with tea.
Large uncut green tea leaves floated in delicate cups; and over
the cup and in it a second cup put upside down made a cover.
There followed about seventeen courses of meat entrées, delicately
cooked. I thought I would give one of the courses a miss,
and refused a dish. The meal immediately ceased. The plan
was evidently to go on feeding your guests till they had had
enough, and then to stop. On the following day, the Mandarins,
who had been present, left large red slips of paper, covered
with elegant characters, on us; these were visiting-cards to
say they would call the same afternoon, and in the afternoon
they paid us a visit in person.</p>

<p>Here at Mukden we lived, and here we fretted, and I fretted
more than anyone, as I was so inexperienced in journalism that
I thought it was impossible to write to the newspaper unless
something startling happened. Now I know better. Had I
had more experience then, I should have known that Mukden
was a mine of copy. One night we gave a dinner-party at the
Der-Lung-Den and invited all the correspondents and the
Press censors as well. We edited a newspaper for the occasion,
of which one copy was written out by hand.</p>

<p>The <i>Mukden Nichevo</i> published articles in French and in
English; notes, poems, a short story, and had an illustrated
cover.</p>

<p>Afoo and his fellow-servitors were in their glory when there
was a dinner-party. Their organisation was as sure as their
service was swift and dexterous. They were quite imperturbable,
and if one suddenly said a few moments before dinner:
“There will be four extra to dinner to-night,” they would calmly
say: “Can do.” Directly he came into my service Afoo asked
for a rise of wages. He thought soldiers and fighting in general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and especially war, vulgar. Once I told him he was stupid.
“Of course,” he said, “I am stupid. If I were not stupid I
should not be your servant, but a Mandarin.”</p>

<p>From Mukden we went to Liaoyang, where we arrived on
the 22nd of June. Liaoyang was a smaller town than Mukden,
and even dirtier and more picturesque. I lived at the Hôtel
International, which was kept by a Greek. It was a Chinese
house converted into an hotel, and had about twenty rooms,
as small as boxes, each containing a stool, a small basin, and
the semblance of a bedstead. The building was incredibly
dirty and squalid; the rooms opened on to a filthy yard;
there was a noisy and dirty buffet, where one had food if one
waited for hours; and also a hall open to the sky, which was
covered by an awning of matting during the hotter hours of
the day. The railway station was the general rendezvous
and the centre of Liaoyang life. There, too, was a buffet
and its ceiling was black with flies, so black that you could not
see a single white spot in it. I fell ill at this hotel and had a
bad attack of dysentery. I spent the first day and night of my
illness at the hotel, in the fly-haunted squalor of the Hôtel International,
in a high, delirious fever. My Chinese servant disappeared
for two days, as there was a feast going on, and when
he returned I dismissed him. But I was rescued by Dr. Westwater,
who had lived at Liaoyang for years, and had a clean,
comfortable house with a beautiful garden. In those clean
surroundings and comforts I soon recovered, and in July,
Brooke and myself, with two Montenegrin servants, left for
Tashichiao. We had been attached to a cavalry brigade of
the First Siberian Army Corps, which was commanded by
General Samsonoff. We went by train to Tashichiao, with the
two Montenegrins, two mules, and five ponies, which it took
twelve hours to entrain. The night I arrived at Tashichiao I
met Count Bobrinsky, a St. Petersburg friend, and he took me
into General Kuropatkin’s train and gave me tea in his mess,
and while I was there General Kuropatkin came in himself and
drank tea. Brooke and I spent the night in the presbytery of
the Catholic church in the village.</p>

<p>I rode to a village a few miles south-west of Tashichiao, and
there I found the headquarters of the Brigade established in
the kitchen garden of a Chinese house. This was the beginning
of a new life in a new world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>That year in Manchuria the rainy season, instead of coming
at its proper times and lasting as long as it should have lasted,
came in sections and by fits and starts. So the country was
either a baked desert or a sea of mud. Looking back on that
time now, I see, on the horizon, a range of soft blue mountains.
In the foreground, there is a Chinese village built of mud and
fenced with mud, and baked by the sun, yellow and hard.
There is, perhaps, a little stream with stepping-stones in it;
a delicate temple, one-storied and painted red like lacquer,
on the water bank, and round it, as far as eye can see, fields of
giant millet. The women, dressed in dark blue, the blue of
blue china, stand at the doorsteps, smoking their long-stemmed
pipes, and there is a crowd of brown, fat, naked children with
budding pig-tails.</p>

<p>Then I see the battlefield of Tashichiao: a low range of soft
blue hills in the distance; to the west a large expanse of the most
brilliant vivid green, from which the cone of an isolated kopje
arose; to the east some dark green hills, with patches of sand,
and at their base a stretch of emerald-green giant millet; in
the middle of the plain a hot, sandy road; blazing heat and a
cloudless sky, and Japanese shells bursting in puffs of brown
and grey, as if someone was blowing rings of tobacco smoke
across the mountains. This battle was a long artillery duel,
which went on from early morning until nine in the evening.
Colonel Gaedke, who was looking on, said the Russians were
shooting well. I wondered how he could tell.</p>

<p>In the evening, after that day’s battle, I rode back to
Tashichiao to the presbytery of the Catholic church, where
the French correspondents had been living.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock in the evening when I got home. Two
Chinamen had just arrived to rebuild the church. They had
pulled down the altar, and at the top of the ladder were working
quietly at a new frieze. My two Montenegrin servants were
quarrelling fiercely in the yard and throwing brushes and
pans at each other. My Chinese boy had prepared a hot bath
in the middle of the yard. A Russian gunner, grimy with dirt
and sweat, and worn out with fighting, staggered into the yard
and said a prayer, when he noticed the building was a church.
The day after this, the first of many long retreats began, ending
at Haichen station, where the buffet was full of people and
where I managed to do a difficult thing—difficult in Manchuria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
that is to say, where the trains waited sometimes eighteen
hours at a station—to miss the train, and I slept on the platform.</p>

<p>After that, I remember a train journey to Liaoyang, and a
soldier crying in the train because another soldier, after using
strings of blood-curdling language and startling obscenities,
which did not produce any effect, as they were like worn-out
counters, called him a <i>sheep</i>; and another soldier dropping his
rifle from the train, and jumping from the train to pick it up.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of July, a ride back to Haichen, a distance
of thirty miles, carried out in two stages, and a night spent on
the grass at a railway siding where soldiers who guarded the
line lived. The soldiers entertained me and gave me soup and
bread, and tea, some cucumber, and some sugar. I thought of
Byron’s example of something solemn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“An Arab with a stranger for a guest.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">My host had lived in this isolated land-lighthouse for four and
a half years. He and the other soldiers talked of places, and
one of them said the Red Sea lay between Japan and China, near
Colombo. Another said that the English had taken Thibet.
They made me a bed with some hay and a blanket, and I slept
in the field. Then came a start at dawn and a ride to Haichen,
where there was bustle and confusion, and a battle expected;
and there, for the first time, I saw the ghastly sight of maimed
soldiers being carried in with their fresh bandages, their recent
wounds, their waxen faces, and their vague, wondering eyes.
After that, a night in the village disturbed by a panic, and
shouts that the Japanese were upon us, followed by the discovery
that it was a false alarm, and the further discovery that
the expected battle would not happen. We rode back to
Liaoyang, after which I was laid up with sunstroke and again
cured by Dr. Westwater.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week of August, I started once more
to find the Cavalry Brigade to which I had been attached.
This time I took with me Dimitri, a dark-eyed Caucasian with a
black beard and a nose like a beak, dressed in a long brown
skirt with silver trimmings, and armed with a scimitar and
several revolvers. Dimitri had lived in the saddle all his life,
and when I complained of my pony stumbling, he said: “It’s
not the pony; the truth is, little father, that just a little you
don’t know how to ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>I found the Brigade. It was commanded by a new General,
called Sichkhov. He was sitting in the small and dirty room of
a Chinese cottage; a telegraph was ticking in the room next
door, and everywhere flies were buzzing. “Have you brought
us any food?” said the General. “We have nothing here, no
bread, no sugar.”</p>

<p>The General and the staff lived in the cottage in which
there were two rooms. The rest of us lived in a garden. At
the bottom of the garden there was a piece of trellis-work, over
which a pumpkin twined and climbed. Under it was my valise.
This was my bedroom. This was in the village of Davantientung.
I stayed there six days. We used to get up very early at four
or five. I would say “Good morning” to the doctor. He
would draw back his hand and say: “I beg your pardon, I
have not washed.” The ceremony of washing was performed
like this: you took off your shirt, and a Cossack poured water
from a pewter cup over your head and your hands, and you
could use as much soap as you pleased. At noon we had our
midday meal, then we drank tea and slept; later we went for
a walk, perhaps, and had supper in the evening, and then bed.
But torrents of rain fell, and this idyllic garden soon became a
swamp. I moved to another neighbouring Brigade, commanded
by Colonel Gurko, and while I was there I dined with one of his
batteries, a horse battery of Trans-Baikalian Cossacks. They
asked me to stay with them for good, and I did so. The night
after I had dined with the battery, the doctor took me to a
church where there was a Chinese Catholic priest. His presbytery
was scrupulously clean, and the church was full of paper
roses. In the presbytery sat an old bronzed Chinaman reading
his breviary. He talked French, with a somewhat limited
vocabulary, but with a pure French intonation, and he gave
us a glass of <i>fine champagne</i>. The day after this we were
ordered to go to Davantientung, the village I had just left.
There we occupied a large Chinese house with a dirty yard in
front of it. Here a new epoch began for me—life with a battery.
The Commander of the battery, Colonel Philemonov, was
away in hospital. His place was taken by a fat, Falstaffian,
good-natured man, with a heart of gold, called Malinovsky,
who knew next to nothing about gunnery. The gunnery work
was performed by a junior Lieutenant, Kislitsky. There were
other younger officers, a doctor, and a veterinary surgeon. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
all lived in one room of the Chinese house; our beds were
stretched side by side along the <i>K’ang</i>—the natural platform
of every Chinese house. We got up at sunrise, and had dinner
at noon. Dinner consisted of huge chunks of meat, cut up and
mixed with potatoes, and served in a pail. This dish the cook
used to call <i>Bœuf Strogonoff</i>, and it was the only dish he knew.
Sometimes the officers struck and demanded something else,
but the dish always ended by being <i>Bœuf Strogonoff</i>.</p>

<p>After dinner, we used to sleep on the <i>K’ang</i>, talk and sleep,
and then go for a walk, talk, sleep once more, and go to bed.
The weather was very hot; when it rained, which it did
torrentially once every ten days, it was hotter. Every house
you saw was made of yellow-baked mud; on each side of you
were endless immense stretches of giant millet fields, of an
intense blinding green. There was an irresistible languor in
the air.</p>

<p>In the yard outside, the horses munched green beans in the
mud. Inside the <i>fangtse</i> all the flies of the world seemed to have
congregated. In spite of the heat, one took shelter under anything,
even a fur rug. To eat and sleep was all one thought
about; but sleep was difficult and the food was monotonous
and scanty. Insects of all kinds crawled from the dried walls
on to one’s head. Outside the window, two or three Chinese
used to argue in a high-pitched voice about the price of something.
There was perhaps a fragment of a newspaper four
months old which one had read and re-read. The military
situation had been discussed until there was nothing more to
be said. Nowhere was there any ease for the body or rest for
the eye—an endless monotony of green and yellow; a land
where the rain brought no freshness and the trees afforded no
shade. The brain refused to read; it circled round and round
in some fretful occupation such as half inventing an acrostic.</p>

<p>When Bron Herbert read the account I wrote of life during
this period of the war, he wrote and told me that it had vividly
brought back to him his experiences of camp life in South
Africa.</p>

<p>“No fellow,” he wrote, “who hasn’t been through it can
know what it’s like. The way that everyone <i>says</i> exactly the
same things that they would say if they were in London, and all
the time they’re <i>doing</i> most absurdly different things. The
way that one drifts clean out of one’s little circle, of which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
has formed an integral part and in which one has been absorbingly
interested, and instantaneously finds oneself in another
quite new one in which one becomes in a few seconds a vastly
important component part and equally absorbed. The way
in which one really spends nine-tenths of one’s time sitting in
some beastly place without shade, brushing flies off one’s face,
and somehow one isn’t bored with it. The way in which all
things which are most boring at home become most interesting
out there. The way in which everything is rather a blur,
nothing very distinct but all one’s sensations funny ones, quite
new and different; only the isolated little incidents stand out
clear like oases. There’s no general impression left. It’s like
tops of mountains sticking up through a fog.”</p>

<p>These are the kind of incidents I remember. One night a
man arrived at Davantientung from Moscow. We put him up.
When he woke up in the morning he said: “I was dreaming
that I was going to the Art Theatre in Moscow. I had got
tickets; they were doing a new play by Tchekov. I wake up
and find myself here.”</p>

<p>Another time a translation of H. G. Wells’s <i>Food of the
Gods</i> appeared in a Russian journal, and two officers fought for
it, and rolled on the floor till the magazine was torn to bits;
and they neither of them wanted it really.</p>

<p>The doctor of the battery and one of the young officers
would argue about the war, about the absurdity of war; that if
you go to war it is silly to look after the wounded. The gospel
of frightfulness was advocated and rejected. Endless discussions
followed.</p>

<p>One evening, the Cossacks bathed their horses in a lake
hard by and swam about naked, like Centaurs. It was
a wonderful lake, full of pink lotus flowers, which in the
twilight, with the rays of the new moon shining on the floating
tangled mass of green leaf (the leaves by this time were grey
and shimmering) and the broad pink petals of the flowers,
made a harmony that seemed to call for the brush of some
delicate French impressionist painter. But no painter could
have reproduced the silvery magic of those greys and greens,
the fantastic spectacle made by the moonlight, the twilight, the
shining water, the dusky leaves, and the delicate lotus petals.
Those days at Davantientung were long days. I suppose I was
not really there a long time, but it seemed an eternity. I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
back to Liaoyang in the middle of August, to post a letter, and
then found my way back to the battery by a miracle, for they
had moved, and I arrived at the very door of their new quarters.
Then the long dream of the sweltering <i>entr’acte</i> came to an
end. We suddenly got orders to move at two o’clock in the
morning. We marched to a large village, and in the afternoon
we moved on to another place where, just as I had taken the
saddle off my pony, and was lying down in a Chinese temple, I
heard a stir. The Japanese were reported to be less than a mile
from us, and had entered the end of the village we had just left,
while the dragoons were going out of the other end of it. We
marched till midnight and then rested, and at dawn we started
by a circuitous route for Liaoyang, which we reached about
three o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">BATTLES</span></h2>

<p>We established ourselves in a small village about two
miles from the town of Liaoyang. Everything was
calm. This was on 29th August, and a battle was
expected on the next day. Kuropatkin was rumoured to have
said that he would offer a tall candle to Our Lady at Moscow if
the Japanese fought at Liaoyang. A little to the south of us
was a large hill called So-shan-tse; to the east a circle of hills;
to the north, the town of Liaoyang. A captive balloon soared
slowly up in the twilight. It did not astonish the Chinese.</p>

<p>We lay down to sleep. Nobody thought there would be a
battle the next day. Colonel Philemonov had arrived at the
battery the evening we left Davantientung. I had not seen
him before, and the battery up to then had been commanded
nominally, and in a social sense by Malinovski, but in a military
sense by Kislitski. The first time I set eyes on Colonel Philemonov
was in the grey dawn in a Chinese house at the first
place we stopped at after Davantientung. He was sitting
at a window in a grey tunic. Being shortsighted, I mistook
him for one of the other officers, and I went boldly up to
him and was about to slap him on the back when he slowly
turned his grey-bearded face towards me and looked up inquiringly
with a grunt. I fled. I knew him by reputation.
He was said to be the best artillery officer in the Siberian Army,
and had formed the three Transbaikalian horse batteries. He
had returned no better from the hospital, and was suffering from
a terrible internal disease; but nothing overcame his indomitable
pluck.</p>

<p>We had scarcely laid ourselves down to rest when we received
orders to move to a village in the east. The horses were
saddled, and we marched to a village on the hills east of So-shan-tse,
about two miles off. There we once more settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
down in a Chinese house, and I fell into a heavy sleep. I was
roused from this by the noise of rifle fire. There were faint
pink streaks in the eastern sky. The village was on an elevation,
but around us were still higher hills. You could hear
guns and rifles. The battle had begun. We moved out of
the village to a hill about a hundred yards to the north-west
of it; here there was an open space of slopes and knolls, not
high enough to command a view of the surrounding country.
Two regiments of infantry were standing at ease on the hills,
and as General Stackelberg, the Commander of the First Army,
and his Staff rode through the village, at the foot of our knoll,
the men saluted him, shouting the usual formula. He was
wearing a white tunic, and I think most of the men thought
he was the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Officers stood on rocks, surveying the position through their
glasses. The scene looked like a battle-picture: the threatening
grey sky, splashed with watery fire; the infantry going
into action, and the men cheering the General, as he rode along
with his smart Staff in his spotless white tunic and gold shoulder
straps. To complete the picture, a shell burst in a compound
in front of us, where some dragoons had halted. Presently, we
moved off to the west, and the battery was placed at the extreme
edge of the plain of millet, west of the tall hill of So-shan-tse.
Colonel Philemonov and Kislitski climbed up this hill and
directed the fire from the top, on the right side of it, transmitting
his orders by a ladder of men placed at intervals down
the hill. The whole battle occupied an area of about 20 square
miles. I climbed to the top of the hill. It was a grey day,
and all you could see was a vast plain of millet. The battery
was firing on a Japanese battery to the south-west, at a range
of about 5000 yards. I could see the flash of the Japanese
guns through my field-glasses when they fired. Every now
and then you could make out in a village, or a portion of the plain
where there was a clearing in the millet, little figures like Noah’s
Ark men, which one knew to be troops. Colonel Philemonov
lay on the side of the hill, and with him were Kislitski and the
doctor. The Colonel was too ill to do much himself, and, during
the greater part of the day, it was Kislitski who gave the range.
The Colonel was wrapped in a Caucasian cloak, and every now
and then he checked or slightly modified Kislitski’s orders.
Kislitski was the most brilliant officer I met during the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
He was cultivated and thoughtful; he knew his business and
loved it. It was an art to him, and he must have had the
supreme satisfaction of the artist when he exercises his powers
and knows that his work is good. He was absolutely fearless,
and never thought of himself or of his career. He was responsible
for the battery’s splendidly accurate firing in nearly
every engagement. He got little credit for it, but he did not
need it; his wages were fully paid to him while he was at work.
Moreover, anything that accrued to the Colonel was fully
deserved, because he had created the battery; the officers
were his pupils; and his personal influence pervaded it. He
was always there, and ready, if anything went badly, to surmount
his physical suffering and deal with the crisis.</p>

<p>The Japanese attack moved slowly like a wave from the
south to the south-west, until in the evening, about seven o’clock,
they were firing west of the railway line. Three guns of the
battery were taken and placed at the top of a small elevation
which lay at the foot and west of So-shan-tse, and fired due west
towards the red setting sun, over the green <i>kowliang</i> in which
the Japanese infantry were advancing and breaking like a wave
on a rock. All day long the Japanese had been firing at us,
but the shells fell to the right of us in the millet, and on the
evening of the first day we had no casualties of any kind. Towards
sunset it began to rain. I was sitting on the edge of
a road with a young officer of the battery, a Transbaikalian
called Hliebnikov, who had been shouting orders all day in
command of a section. He was hoarse from shouting, and deaf
from the noise. I was deaf too. We could neither of us hear
what the other said, and we shared a frugal meal out of a tin
of potted meat. A soldier near us had his pipe shot out of
his mouth by a bullet. I shouted to him that it was rather
a dangerous place. He shouted back that he was too hungry
to care. By sunset the Japanese attack had been driven back.
From the spectator’s point of view, the <i>kowliang</i>, the giant
green millet, hid everything. From a hill you could see the
infantry disappear into the <i>kowliang</i>; you could hear the firing,
and the battle seemed to be going on underground. In the
evening you saw the result in the stream of wounded and mangled
men who were carried from the field to the ambulances.</p>

<p>A terrible procession was wending its way to Liaoyang—some
of the men on foot, others carried on stretchers. I met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
one man walking quietly. He had a bandage soaked red round
the lower part of his face; his tongue and lips had been shot
away. Nightfall found us sitting on a small knoll at the base
of So-shan-tse hill; it had rained heavily. There was no prospect
of shelter for the night. Colonel Philemonov was sitting
wrapped up in his Caucasian cloak, tired and white; he was in
pain. A Cossack had been sent to a village to find a house for
us, and to make tea. He did not come back, and Kislitski and
I went to look for him. We came to a house in the village of
Moe-tung and found a number of soldiers warming themselves
round the fire. The Cossack said there was no accommodation,
as the rooms on the left were occupied by the Japanese prisoners,
those on the right by the Russian dead. There was a shed in
the yard—and he pointed to it—full of refuse. This Cossack
was an old soldier and he knew his man. Kislitski was extraordinarily
fastidious about cleanliness and food. He would
rather starve than eat food which he disliked, and stand up in
the rain sooner than sleep in a hovel. Kislitski went away in
disgust. I stayed and warmed myself by the fire. Soon five
or six officers of an infantry regiment arrived, hungry and
drenched. The Cossack met them and told them the whole
house had been engaged by the Commander and officers of the
2nd Transbaikalian Battery, who would presently arrive, and
the officers went away disgusted.</p>

<p>I went back to the battery on the knoll, and it was settled
we should remain where we were. After a while the doctor
and Hliebnikov asked me to take them to the house to see what
could be done. We went back and discovered lights burning
in a room we had not been shown before, and there the Cossack
and his friends were enjoying a plentiful supper of cheese,
sausages, hot tea, and a bottle of vodka. There we lay down
to sleep, but not for long; we were wakened by bullets at one
in the morning. The Japanese were attacking the village. I
saddled my pony and made for my battery, but lost the way.
I met a wounded soldier in the <i>kowliang</i>. He couldn’t walk.
I lifted him on to my pony, and we found a Red Cross Station
in a Chinese temple, and the man was rebandaged. We moved
slowly, and on the way this man said to me: “Tell me, little
father, what made the Japanese so angry with us?” (“<i>Po chemu
tak rasserdilis?</i>”). I slept in the yard of the temple on some
stones. Firing began again at dawn, and I soon found my way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
back to the battery. The guns were where they had been the
day before, but they pointed west. The Colonel and Kislitski
were no longer on the big hill, but on the top of the smaller
one, at the foot and to the west of it. The Japanese had
partially regained in the night the ground they had lost in
the day. They had got the range of our battery. One man
was wounded soon after I arrived. I crossed the road and
climbed the small hill. What a short time that takes to write,
but what a long time it took to do! An eternity. I went
half-way across, came back, and then started again. I thought
every shell must hit me. When I climbed the hill and found the
Colonel and Kislitski I felt more comfortable. The Japanese
were firing at us from a battery about two miles off. Shells
sometimes burst on the road and in front of us. It was
the first time I had been under shrapnel fire. The first
time I had been under any kind of fire for any prolonged
period. The Japanese were firing both shrapnel and shell now.
I remember time passed quickly, as if someone had been
turning the wheel of things at a prodigious unaccustomed
rate. I heard that Hliebnikov had been wounded in the night
and sent to the hospital. I stayed on the knoll till one o’clock.
Then there was a pause. I left the knoll and sought a safer
place near the horses; then I went to see what was happening
elsewhere. A long stream of wounded men was flowing to the
Red Cross Stations and from there to Liaoyang. The noise
was louder than ever. I started to go back to the battery,
and met one of the officers, who told me it had been moved.
I foolishly believed him. I learnt afterwards this was not true;
they stayed in their position till nine. At the end of the second
day the Japanese were driven back two miles to the west. On
the east they took a trench, which was never retaken. Then
came the news of Kuroki’s turning movement. On the following
morning Liaoyang, with its triple line of defences, was left to
defend itself, while the rest of the army crossed the river. It
was neither a victory nor a defeat for either side.</p>

<p>The battle was over but not the fighting, for all through
the night of the 31st the Japanese attacked the forts. A
Cossack officer, who was in one of them told me that the sight
was terrible; that line after line of Japanese came smiling
up to the trenches and were mown down till the trenches were
full of bodies, and then more came on over the bodies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
dead. One of the officers who was in the fort went mad from
horror.</p>

<p>I rode back towards the town in the evening; on the
way I met Brooke, who had been with General Stackelberg.
We turned back to watch some regiments going into action
towards the east, and then we rode back to Liaoyang with
streams of ambulances, stretchers, and wounded men walking
on foot. The terrible noise continued.</p>

<p>I thought of all the heroes of the past, from the Trojan War
onward, and of the words which those who have not fought their
country’s battles, but made their country’s songs, have said
about these men and their deeds, and I asked myself, Is that
all true? Is it true that these things become like the shining
pattern on a glorious banner, the captain jewels of a great crown,
which is the richest heirloom of nations? Or is all this an
illusion? Is war an abominable return to barbarism, the
emancipation of the beast in man, the riot of all that is bad,
brutal, and hideous; the suspension and destruction of civilisation
by its very means and engines; and are those songs and
those words which stir our blood merely the dreams of those
who have been resolutely secluded from the horrible reality?
And then I thought of the sublime courage of Colonel
Philemonov, and of the thousands of unknown men who had
fought that day in the <i>kowliang</i>, without the remotest notion of
the why and wherefore, and I thought that war is to man what
motherhood is to woman—a burden, a source of untold suffering,
and yet a glory.</p>

<p>After the battle of Liaoyang there followed another <i>entr’acte</i>.
I lost my battery and they were sent north to rest. I arrived
at Mukden on 2nd September, and from there I went on a short
expedition to General Miskchenko’s Corps with M’Cullagh, one of
the correspondents. Nothing of great interest happened while
I was there, except that one day we took part in a reconnaissance.
Later, I paid a visit to a corps on the extreme right, near Sin-min-tin,
about twenty-six miles from Mukden. I spent a week there
in a village with a Colonel who commanded a Cavalry Brigade.
These were delicious days. The landscape was rich and woody;
the <i>kowliang</i> had been reaped; there was an autumnal haze over
the landscape and a subtle chill in the air; the leaves were not
yet brown, and there were no signs of decay; but the dawns
were chilly and the evenings short. One of the officers went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
out shooting pheasants with his retriever every afternoon.
Wild duck used to fly over the village in the evening, sometimes
wild geese as well, and there were wild duck in abundance
on a reedy lake near the village. Someone here had
two long books of Dostoievsky: <i>The Idiot</i> and <i>The Brothers
Karamazov</i>. I remember devouring them both. I had only
read <i>Crime and Punishment</i> up till then, and these two books
were a revelation. I got back to Mukden at the beginning
of October, and at the railway station I met an officer belonging
to the battery, who told me they had just arrived from the north.
I found them near the station, and there I met all my old friends.
They had been right up to Kuan-chen-tse and then to Harbin
and back. The Colonel was still an invalid and in bed. We
moved from a cold field, where we were under canvas, into a
temple, or rather a house inhabited by a Buddhist priest, and
enjoyed two days of perfect calm. The building consisted of
three quadrangles surrounded by a high stone wall. The first
of the quadrangles was like a farmyard. There was a lot of
straw lying about, some broken ploughshares, buckets, wooden
bowls, spades, hoes, and other furniture of toil. A few hens
hurried about searching for grain here and there; a dog was
sleeping in the sun. At the farther end of the yard a cat seemed
to have set aside a space for its private use. This farmyard
was separated from the next quadrangle by the house of the
priest, which occupied the whole of the second enclosure; that
is to say, the living-rooms extended right round the quadrangle,
leaving an open space in the centre. The part of the house
which separated the second quadrangle from the next consisted
solely of a roof supported by pillars, making an open
verandah, through which, from the second enclosure, you could
see into the third. The third enclosure was a garden with a
square grass plot and some cypress trees. At the farthest end
of the garden was the temple itself—a small pagoda, full of
carved and painted idols.</p>

<p>When we arrived here the priest welcomed us and established
us in rooms in the second quadrangle. The Cossacks
encamped in a field on the other side of the farmyard, but the
treasure-chest was put in the farmyard itself, and a sentry stood
near it with a drawn sword. A child moved about the place.
He was elegantly dressed. His little eyes twinkled like onyxes,
and his hands were beautifully shaped. This child moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
about the farmyard with the dignity of an emperor and the
serenity of a great pontiff. Gravely and without a smile he
watched the Cossacks unharnessing their horses, lighting a fire,
and arranging the officers’ kit. He walked up to the sentry,
who was standing near the treasure-chest, a big, grey-eyed
Cossack, with a great tuft of fair hair, and the expression of a
faithful retriever, and said: “Ping!” in a tone of indescribable
contempt. “Ping” in Chinese means soldier-man, and if one
wishes to express contempt for a man there is no word in the
whole of the Chinese language which does it so effectually. The
Cossack smiled on the child and called him by every kind of
endearing diminutive, but he took no notice and retired into the
inner part of the house. The next day curiosity got the better
of him, and one of the Cossacks—his name was Lieskov, and he
looked after my mule—made friends with him by playing with
the dog. The dog was dirty and distrustful and not used to
being played with. He was too thin to be eaten. But Lieskov
tamed this dog and taught him how to play, and the big Cossack
used to roll on the ground, while the dog pretended to bite him.
I remember coming home that same afternoon from a short
stroll with one of the officers, and we found Lieskov fast asleep
in the yard across the steps of the door, and the Chinese child
and the dog were sitting next to him. We woke up Lieskov,
and the officer asked him why he had gone to sleep. “I was
playing with the dog,” he said, “and I played so hard that I
was exhausted and fell asleep.”</p>

<p>There was something infinitely quiet and beautiful in that
temple, with its enclosures of trees and grass, bathed in the
October sunshine. The time we spent there seemed very long
and very short, like a pleasant dream. The weather was so
soft and fine, the sunshine so bright, that had not the nights
been chilly we should never have dreamt it was autumn. It
seemed rather as if the spring had been unburied and had
returned to earth by mistake. I remember one of the officers
saying: “Thank Heavens we were in the deepest reserve.”
We seemed to be sheltered from the world in an island of dreamy
lotus-eating; and the only noise that reached us was the sound
of the tinkling gongs of the temple. We lived a life of absolute
indolence, getting up with the sun, eating, playing cards,
strolling about on the plains, whence the millet had been reaped,
eating again, and going to bed about nine. Then the calm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
suddenly broken, and we received orders to start for the front
and join the First European Corps, which formed part of the
reserve.</p>

<p>We started for the front on the afternoon of the 6th of
October, and we did not reach any place where fighting was
going on till the 12th. Those intervening days were spent
in marches and halts in Chinese villages. At one of our halting-places
I was billeted with Kislitski, who always lived apart,
as he could not bear the public life and the public food of a mess.
He sat up all one night making a mysterious implement of
wood, something to do with rectifying the angle of sight of the
guns, and singing to himself passages from Lermontov’s poem,
“The Demon,” as he worked.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th we arrived at a Chinese village,
where to the south of us there was a range of hills which continued
like a herring-bone right on to Yantai. In these hills a
desperate battle was going on. The battle was drawing nearer
to us, and we were drawing nearer to the battle. Firing went
on all night. The next day, at six o’clock in the morning,
artillery fire began, and from a small hill in front of our position
I got a splendid view of the fighting. The <i>kowliang</i> was reaped,
and one could see to the east successive ranges of brown undulating
hills, and to the west a plain black with little dots of
infantry. In the extreme distance, to the south-west of the
hill on which I stood, were the hills of Yantai. On a higher
hill in front of that on which I was standing the infantry was
taking up its position, and the Japanese shrapnel was falling
on it. The infantry retired and moved to the south-west, and
it looked at first as if there was going to be a general retreat.</p>

<p>The firing went on without interruption until ten minutes
to seven in the evening. In the night it rained heavily; the
noise of thunder was as loud as the noise of the guns. News
of terrific fighting kept on arriving—a battery was lost and
a regiment cut up, and the wounded began to stream past our
camp. Rifle fire went on all night.</p>

<p>The next morning punctually at half-past six the guns
began once more. The battle had got still nearer. The shells
were falling closer and closer. I turned round and saw through
my field-glasses that our camp was astir. I ran back and was
met by my Buriat servant, who was leading my pony. Shells
began to fall on the hill where I had been standing. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
half-past eight in the morning, and we were just ready and
expecting to start when we were told to remain where we were.
The shelling stopped. A little before one o’clock a regiment
of the First Corps which was in front of us were told to retreat.
It was said that the enemy was beginning to turn our right
flank. The battery were ordered to fire on a Japanese battery
to the south-west, to cover the retreat of a Russian field battery.</p>

<p>The battery went into action at twenty minutes to three.
The guns were masked behind the houses of the village, and
Colonel Philemonov climbed up a high tree, so as to get a better
view. Knowing how ill he was and that he might have a
paroxysm of pain at any moment, my blood ran cold. He could
not see well enough from the tree, and he moved up the slope of
the hill. He began to give out the range, but after two rounds
had been fired he fell almost unconscious to the ground, and
Kislitski took over.</p>

<p>The Japanese were firing Shimosé shells. We saw a torn
mass of a tree or <i>kowliang</i> scattered into fragments by the
explosion of a shell. But when at three o’clock we left the
position we saw it was not <i>kowliang</i> nor a tree that had been
blown up, but a man. We took up our position on another
and higher hill, and the battery fired west, at the farthest possible
range, on the Japanese infantry, which we could see moving
in that direction against the horizon. This lasted till sunset.
At dusk we marched into a village. The infantry was lying in
trenches ready for the night attack. Some of the men had
been killed by shells, and at the edge of a trench I saw two
human hands. The next morning the noise of firing began at
four o’clock. We moved into a road and waited for the dawn.
It was dark. The firing seemed to be close by. The Cossacks
made a fire and cooked bits of meat on a stick. At dawn, news
came that the assault of the enemy had been repulsed and that
we were to join later on in an attack. The Colonel went to
look for a suitable position. I went with him. From the top
of a high hill we could see through a glass the Japanese infantry
climbing a hill immediately south of our former camp. The
Japanese climbed the hill, lay down, and fired on the Russian
infantry to the east of them. The Russians were screened from
our sight by another hill. The battery fired at first from
the foot of the hill, and the enemy answered back from the east
and the west. We had to move to a position on a hill farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
north, whence we fired on a battery three miles off. The
battery went into action at eight. Colonel Philemonov,
Kislitski, and I lay on the turf at the top of the hill. Kislitski
gave the range. The Colonel had begun to do it himself, but
had fallen back exhausted. “I love my business,” he said to
me, “and now that I get a chance of doing it, I can’t. All the
same, they know I’m here.” About an hour after the battery
had begun to fire, the Japanese infantry came round through
the valley and occupied a hill to the north-west of us, and
opened fire first on our infantry, which was beneath us and in
front of us, and then on the battery. The sergeant came and
reported that men were being wounded and horses had been
killed: an officer called Takmakov, who had just joined the
battery, was wounded. The Japanese infantry were 1200
yards from us. Three of the guns were then reversed and fired
on the infantry. This went on till noon. You could see the
Japanese without a glass. With a glass one could have recognised
a friend. At noon the infantry retired, and we were left
unprotected, and had to retreat at full speed under shrapnel
and infantry fire. My pony was not anywhere near. I had
to run. The Colonel saw this and shouted to the men to give
me a horse, and a Cossack brought me a riderless horse, which
was difficult to climb on to, as it had a high Cossack saddle and
all a Cossack’s belongings on it.</p>

<p>We crossed the river Sha-ho, and just as everyone was
expecting a general retreat to Mukden, we were told to recross
the river. It began to rain. As we crossed the river, one
of the horses had the front of its face torn off by shrapnel.
We took up a position on the other side of the river; the first
few shots of the enemy fell with alarming precision on the
battery, but the Japanese altered the range, and their shells
fell wide. Twenty minutes later the enemy’s fire ceased all
along the line. Afterwards we knew that the reason why it
ceased was because the Japanese had run short of ammunition.
Kislitski and I walked towards the south to see what was going
on. We climbed to the top of an isolated cottage, but could
see nothing. Then we came back, and the battery set out for
a village south-west by a circuitous route across the river.
Nobody knew the way. We marched and marched until it
grew dark. The Colonel was in great pain. Some Cossacks
and Chinese were sent to find the village. We halted for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
hour by a wet ploughed field. At last they came back and led
us to the village. We expected to find the transport there.
I was hoping to find dry clothing and hot food, as we were
drenched to the skin and half-dead with hunger and fatigue.
When we arrived at the village I was alone with one of the
officers; we dismounted at a bivouac, and the officer went on
ahead, expecting me to follow him. I thought he was to come
back for me. I waited an hour; nobody came; so I started
to look for our quarters. The village was straggling and mazy.
I went into house after house, and only found strange faces. At
last I got a Cossack to guide me, and, after half an hour spent
in fruitless search, we found the house and the officers, but
no transport, no food, and no dry clothing. I gave way to
temper, and was publicly congratulated by the battery for doing
so. They said that it was the first time I had manifested discontent
in public.</p>

<p>I spent the night in the Colonel’s quarters, and we discussed
Russian literature: Dostoievsky, Gogol, and Dickens. He
was surprised at a foreigner being able to appreciate the humour
of Gogol. I was surprised at a foreigner, I told him, being
able to appreciate the humour of Dickens.</p>

<p>At dawn we received orders to hold ourselves ready. Half
an hour later we were told to join the First Siberian Corps,
which had been sent south to attack.</p>

<p>We marched to a village called Nan-chin-tsa, not far from a
hill which the Russians called Poutilov’s Hill, and which the
English called Lonely Tree Hill. It had been taken in the
night by the Japanese. Through a glass you could see men
walking on it, but nobody knew if they were Russians or
Japanese. Two Cossacks were sent to find out. Wounded
men were returning one by one, and in bigger batches, from
every part of the field. It was a brilliant sunshiny day, and the
wounded seemed to rise in a swarm from the earth. It was a
ghastly sight, even worse than at Liaoyang. The bandages
were fresh, and the blood was soaking through the shirts of the
men. The Cossacks came back and reported that the hill was
occupied by the Japanese. We marched back another verst
(two-thirds of a mile) and found the corps bivouacking in the
plain. All along the road we met wounded and mutilated men,
some carried on stretchers and some walking, their wounds fresh
and streaming. We marched another verst south again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the guns were placed behind the village of Fun-chu-Ling,
two miles north of the hill to which General Poutilov gave his
name. On the way we met General Poutilov himself and the
infantry going into action. Colonel Philemonov and I climbed
up on to the thatched roof of a small house, whence he gave the
range. Kislitski was not there. In front of us was a road; our
house was at the extreme right corner of the village; to the
right of us was a field planted with lettuce and green vegetables.
Infantry were marching along the road on their way into action.
A company halted in the field and began eating the lettuce.
The Colonel shouted: “You had better make haste finishing
the green stuff there, children, as I am going to open fire.”
They hurriedly made off, as if they were to be the target, except
one who, greedier than the rest, lingered a little behind the
others, throwing furtive glances at the Colonel lest he should
suddenly fire on them. The guns were in a field behind us,
and immediately under the house where we were perched,
two Chinamen, who had been working in the fields, had made
themselves a dug-out, and towards tea-time they appeared from
the earth, made tea, and then crept back again. The battery
opened fire, and two other batteries shelled the hill, one from the
east and one from the west. The enemy answered with shrapnel,
but not one of these shells touched us; they all fell beyond us.</p>

<p>A little while later, three belated men belonging to a
line regiment walked along the road. Our guns fired a <i>salvo</i>,
upon which these men, startled out of their lives, crouched
down. The Colonel shouted to them from the roof: “Crouch
lower or else you will be shot.” They flung themselves on
the road and grovelled in the dust. “Lower!” shouted
the Colonel. “Can’t you get under the earth?” They
wriggled ineffectually, and lay sprawling like brown fish out
of water. Then the Colonel said: “You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves. Don’t you know my shells are falling three
versts from here? Be off!” At sunset the battery ceased
fire. Soon a tremendous rattle told us the infantry attack had
begun. An officer described this afterwards as a “comb of
fire.” We waited in the dark-red, solemn twilight, and later a
ringing cheer told us the hill had been taken. Someone who
was with us said it was just like manœuvres. But all was not
over, as the Japanese counter-attacked twice. The hill was
partly taken, but at what cost we were presently to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>It grew dark; we sought and found a Chinese house to pass
the night in. Men began to arrive from the hill, and from their
account it was difficult to tell whether the hill had been taken or
not. The Colonel told Hliebnikov to ride to the hill and find
out. Hliebnikov said to me: “He is sending me to be shot
like a dog.” We were just lying down to rest when a wounded
man arrived asking to be bandaged, then another and another.</p>

<p>The doctor of the battery was with us. The nearest Red
Cross Station was eight miles off. Soon the house was full of
wounded, and more were arriving. They lay on the floor, on the
<i>K’angs</i>, on every available place. The room was lit by one candle
and a small Chinese oil-lamp. The men had been wounded
by bullets and bayonets; they were torn, mangled, soaked
in blood. Some of them had broken limbs. Some of them had
walked or crawled two miles from the hill, while others, unable
to move, had been carried on greatcoats slung on rifles. When
one house was full we went to the next, and so on, till all the
houses in the street of the village were filled. Two of the
officers bandaged the slightly wounded, while the doctor dealt
with the severer wounds. The appalling part of the business
was, that one had to turn out of the house by force men who
were only slightly wounded or simply exhausted. Some of
them merely asked to be allowed to rest a moment and drink
a cup of tea, and yet they had to be turned ruthlessly from the
door, to make room for the ever-increasing mass of maimed and
mangled men who were crying out in their pain. As a rule the
wounded soldiers bore their wounds with astonishing fortitude,
but the wounded I am speaking of were so terribly mangled
that many of them were screaming in their agony. Two officers
were brought in. “Don’t bother about us, Doctor,” they said;
“we shall be all right.” We laid these two officers down on
the <i>K’ang</i>. They seemed fairly comfortable; one of them said
he felt cold; and the other that the calf of his leg tingled.
“Would I mind rubbing it?” I lifted it as gently as I could,
but it hurt him terribly; and then I rubbed his leg, which he
said gave him relief. “What are you?” he said—“an interpreter,
or what?” (I had scarcely got on any clothes; what
they were, were Chinese and covered with dirt.) I said I was
a correspondent. He was about to give me something, whether
it was a tip or a small present as a remembrance I shall never
know, for the other officer stopped him and said: “No, no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
you’re mistaken.” He then thanked me. Half an hour later
he died. One seemed to be plunged into the lowest inferno of
human pain. I met a man in the street who had crawled on
all-fours the whole way from the hill. The stretchers were all
being used. The way in which the doctor dealt with the men
was magnificent. He dominated the situation, encouraged
everyone, had the right answer, suppressed the unruly, and
cheered those who needed cheering up.</p>

<p>Each house was so small, the accommodation in it so scanty,
that it took a short time to fill, and we were constantly moving
from one house to another. The floor was in every case so
densely packed with writhing bodies that one stumbled over
them in the darkness. Some of the men were sick from pain;
others had faces that had no human semblance at all. Horrible
as the sight was, the piteousness of it was greater still. The
men were touching in their thankfulness for any little attention,
and noble in the manner they bore their sufferings. We had
tea and cigarettes for the wounded.</p>

<p>I was holding up a man who had been terribly mangled in
the legs by a bayonet. The doctor was bandaging him. He
screamed with pain. The doctor said the screaming upset him.
I asked the man to try not to scream, and lit a cigarette and
put it in his mouth. He stopped immediately and smoked,
and remained quite still—until his socks were taken off. The
men scarcely ever had socks; their feet were swathed in a white
bandage, a kind of linen puttee. This man had socks, and
when they were taken off he cried, saying he would never see
them again. I promised to keep them for him, and he said:
“Thank you, my protector.” A little later he died.</p>

<p>When we gave the soldiers tea or cigarettes, they made the
sign of the Cross and thanked Heaven before they thanked us.</p>

<p>One seemed to have before one the symbol of the whole
suffering of the human race: men like bewildered children,
stricken by some unknown force for some unexplained reason,
crying out and sobbing in their anguish, yet accepting and not
railing against their destiny, and grateful for the slightest
alleviation and help to them in their distress.</p>

<p>We stayed till all the houses were full; at two o’clock in
the morning a detachment of the Red Cross arrived, but they
had their hands full to overflowing. We went to snatch a little
sleep. We had in the meantime heard that the hill had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
taken, and that at dawn the next day we were to proceed
thither.</p>

<p>Before dawn I had some food in the Colonel’s room. While
I was there, he sent for the doctor. “I hear,” he said, “that
you used our bandages for the wounded who came in last night.”
The doctor said this was so. “You had no business to do
that,” said the Colonel. “I am expecting severe fighting to-day,
and if my men are wounded I shall have no bandages for
them.” The doctor said nothing. He knew this was true; every
bandage had been used. “I strictly forbid you to do anything
of the kind again,” said the Colonel. The doctor saluted and
went out. He at once rode to the nearest Red Cross Station,
and came back with a provision of bandages later in the morning.</p>

<p>At dawn we started for Lonely Tree Hill, trotting all the
way. The road was covered with bandages; the dead were
lying about here and there; but when we arrived at the hill
the spectacle was appalling. I was the only foreigner who was
allowed to visit the hill that day. As the Colonel rode up the
hill we passed the body of a Japanese soldier which lay waxen
and stiff on the side of the road, and suddenly began to move.
The hill was littered with corpses. Six hundred Japanese dead
were buried that day, and I do not know how many Russians.
The corpses lay in the dawn, with their white faces and staring
eyes like hateful waxwork figures. Even death seemed to be
robbed of its majesty and made hideous and bedraggled by the
fingers of war. But not entirely. Kislitski, who was with me,
pointed to a dead Japanese officer who was lying on his back,
and told me to look at his expression. He was lying with his
brown eyes wide open and showing his white teeth. But there
was nothing grim or ghastly in that smile. It was miraculously
beautiful; it was not the smile of inscrutable content which
we see on certain statues of sleeping warriors such as that of
Gaston de Foix at Milan, or Guidarello Guidarelli at Ravenna,
but a smile of radiant joy and surprise, as if he had suddenly
met with a friend for whom he had longed, above all things,
at a moment when of all others he had needed him, but for
whose arrival he had not even dared to hope. Near him a
Russian boy was lying, fair and curly-headed, with his head
resting on one arm, as if he had fallen asleep like a tired child
overcome with insuperable weariness, and had opened his eyes
to pray to be left at peace just a little longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The trenches and the ground were littered with all the belongings
of the Japanese: rifles, ammunition, bayonets, leather cases,
field-glasses, scarlet socks, dark-blue greatcoats, yellow caps,
maps, painting-brushes, tablets of Indian ink, soap, toothbrushes,
envelopes full of little black pills, innumerable notebooks,
and picture postcards, received and ready for sending.
Some of the Japanese dead wore crosses. One had a piece of green
ribbon sewn in a little bag hanging round his neck. One had
been shot through a postcard which he wore next to his heart.</p>

<p>I saw a Russian soldier terribly wounded just as he had
begun to eat his luncheon in the shelter of the hill. So
many men were buried that day that the men were faint and
nauseated by the work of burying the dead. The battle was
over, and now there were only daily short periods of mutual
shelling. We lived all day on the hill, and we slept in a broken-down
house at the foot of one end of it. There were no windows
in this house, and the doors had to be used for fuel. The nights
were piercingly cold. The place was full of insects, and we were
covered with lice. I lived for a week on the top of this hill
without anything of particular interest happening, and on the
30th of October I left with Colonel Philemonov, who had been
ordered to Russia by the doctors. He had been getting worse,
and could scarcely move from his bed. In spite of this he
would get up from time to time and, muffled in a cloak, go up
to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>He was given the St. George’s Cross for the battle of the
Sha-ho.</p>

<p>As we rode away he told me how he had lived with his men
and regarded them as his children, and that it broke his heart
to go away. He was a man of forbidding exterior, with rather
a grim manner; he frightened some people, but he was refined
and cultivated, with a quiet sense of humour, the embodiment
of unaffected courage and calm devotion to duty. The men
worshipped him. The officers admired him, but I remember
one day when I rejoined the battery the following year a discussion
at the Mess, when the doctor said that although he
admired Philemonov immensely, he thought a good-natured
officer, whom we had all known, who used frankly to go to the
base whenever there was a chance of fighting, was superior as
a man, a better man, and to my astonishment most of the
officers agreed with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>One curious trait about Philemonov was that he was infinitely
indulgent to clever scamps, if they amused him, and
rather unfair towards conscientious dullards. He punished,
as some poet says somewhere, the just unwise more hardly than
the wise unjust, and he liked being bluffed, and although he
wasn’t really taken in, he was indulgent, more than indulgent,
to a successful piece of bluff. I arrived at Mukden on the 31st
of October, and the battery returned on the 4th of November
to repair the guns. We lived once more in the temple outside
the city walls. The autumn had come and gone. It was
winter. There had been no autumn, but a long summer and
an Indian summer of warm, hazy days. One day the trees
were still green, and the next the leaves had disappeared. The
sky became grey, the snow fell, and the wind cut like a knife.
The exquisite outlines of the country now appeared in all their
beauty. The rare trees with their frail fretwork of branches
stood out in dark and intricate patterns against the rosy haze
of the wintry sunset, softened with innumerable particles of
brown dust, and one realised whence Chinese artists drew their
inspiration, and how the “Cunning worker in Pekin” pricked
on to porcelain the colours and designs which make Oriental
china so beautiful and precious. In the meantime I heard
from the <i>Morning Post</i> that they no longer wanted a correspondent
in Manchuria, so I decided to go home. Had I waited
a few days longer, I could have remained correspondent for the
<i>Standard</i>, but this I did not know till it was too late. I stayed
at Mukden till the 1st of December, when I started for London.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">LONDON, MANCHURIA, RUSSIA</span></h2>

<p>During the summer of 1905 I did a certain amount of
dramatic criticism for the <i>Morning Post</i>. I wrote
notices on some of the foreign plays that were being
given in London during that summer. Several foreign companies
were with us. Duse had a season at the Waldorf Theatre;
Coquelin played in <i>L’Abbé Constantin</i>, rather a tiresome, goody-goody
play; Sarah Bernhardt produced Victor Hugo’s <i>Angelo</i>,
<i>l’Aiglon</i>, <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> (with Mrs. Patrick Campbell),
<i>Phèdre</i>, and <i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i>, not Scribe and Legouvé’s
play, but a play of her own.</p>

<p>I saw Duse display the full range of her powers in Alexandre
Dumas fils’ <i>La Femme de Claude</i>; Goldoni’s <i>La Locandiera</i>;
Dumas’ <i>Une Visite de Noces</i>, <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, <i>Adrienne
Lecouvreur</i>; and D’Annunzio’s <i>Gioconda</i>; Sardou’s <i>Odette</i> and
<i>Fédora</i>.</p>

<p>The most interesting of these performances was, I think, her
Césarine in <i>La Femme de Claude</i>. Duse was blamed for appearing
in a repertory of such plays. She was said to complain
of the repertory herself. But it is doubtful whether, apart
from all booking-office questions of popularity, she would have
appeared to a greater advantage in plays of a more exalted
character. Duse was not a tragic actress in the sense one
imagines Mrs. Siddons and Rachel were tragic. She could
not enlarge a masterpiece of poetry by her interpretation, nor
give you a plastic poetic creation like a piece of a Greek frieze,
as Sarah Bernhardt could and did in <i>Phèdre</i>. She was not the
incarnation of the tragic muse; the gorgeous pall overwhelmed
her; when she played Cleopatra, for instance (Shakespeare’s
Cleopatra much mutilated), her peculiar power seemed to melt
into thin air. I once heard a celebrated French actress, and a
French critic, who had both only seen her play Cleopatra, wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
what her reputation was based on. What she needed was something
between high comedy and tragedy; and this was precisely
what she found in certain parts of the modern repertory
of Ibsen, D’Annunzio, Sardou, Dumas fils, and Pinero, in which
she played during that summer.</p>

<p>Dumas’ play, <i>La Femme de Claude</i>, gave her not only an
opportunity of showing her astonishing skill, her perfect
technique, but it revealed unguessed-of, almost incredible,
aspects of her genius. When she played parts such as
Sudemann’s <i>Magda</i> and <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, one used
to feel as if one ought not to be there; as if one were
peeping through a keyhole at scenes of too intimate and
too sacred a nature for the public eye. When Amando
hurled money and hissed vituperation at her in the fourth
act of <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, one felt as if the police ought
to interfere, and save so noble a creature from outrage.
One doubted whether Duse were an artist or even an actress
in the true sense of the word, and whether all she gave were
not glimpses of the extraordinary nobility of her personality;
whether the play were not beside the question; whether she
might not just as well appear on the stage in her ordinary
clothes and tell us a few confidences—her joys and her sorrows.</p>

<p>But her performance in <i>La Femme de Claude</i> proved the
contrary. It proved that in the subtle and objective interpretation
of a definite character, a character utterly alien
to her own nature, she could rival, if not surpass, any artist in
the world.</p>

<p><i>La Femme de Claude</i> was said by Théodore de Banville to be
a symbolic play. Call it that if you will, or call it a melodrama.
The subject is simple and dramatic, the action rapid and
vigorous. An austere scientific engineer called Claude has
married an evil wife, Césarine. She leaves him. He invents
a new and powerful gun. She comes back. A foreign spy
blackmails her. He threatens to make revelations about her
to her husband, unless she obtains for him the secret of the
gun. At first she defies this man. She says her husband
knows all there is to be known; he then mentions incidents
that her husband cannot know, for the bare knowledge of them
would make him an accessory in crime. She undertakes to get
the secret. She tries to win back her husband, fails, and
then shows her teeth. She sets about to seduce her husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
pupil, a young man who is already in love with her. She
persuades him to give her the papers and her husband shoots
her dead when they are about to elope. At first sight you
would have thought that Duse’s genius was too refined and
too noble to render the snake-like, feline, insinuating,
feverish, treacherous, panther-like, savage nature of Dumas’
she-monster. Sarah Bernhardt is the artist who at once leaps
into the mind as being suited to the part, a part that might
have been written for her. I have seen Sarah Bernhardt play
it and play it superbly. At certain moments she carried you
right off your feet.</p>

<p>But Duse played on the nerves till they vibrated like strings,
in the same manner as she herself was tremulously vibrating.
It was a gradual process of preparation, which began from the
first moment she walked on to the stage until she fell forward
at the end with outstretched hands when she was shot. Her
art was like that of a cunning violinist; the music with its
delicately interwoven themes was phrased in subtle progress and
with divine economy of effect, till she reached the catastrophe,
and then Duse attained to that height where all style disappears,
and only the perfection of art, in which all artifice is concealed,
remains. The climax needed no effort, no strain; it was the way
every note had been struck before, that made it tremendous.</p>

<p>Of course she transfigured Césarine, the heroine; in the
modern repertory she always raised the scale of everything she
touched, so that you cried out for her to play tragedy, and that
was just what she could not do. She did not make Dumas’
heroine a better woman than he intended her to be; but she
made her a greater woman than he can ever have hoped she
would appear. Duse’s Césarine was wicked to the core; not
thoughtlessly non-moral, not invincibly ignorant in her
wickedness, but consciously and deliberately destructive; and
the manifestation and expression of this unmitigated evil was
rendered ten times more impressive by the subtlety of its
expression and the delicate refinement which it was clothed
with and partially disguised. Duse reminded one of Tacitus’
description of Nero’s wife, Poppæa, who, he says, professed
virtue but practised vice; and whose demeanour was irreproachably
modest. “Sermo comis nec absurdum ingenium:
modestiam præferre et lascivia uti.”</p>

<p>When she met Claude’s young pupil in the first act, she gave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
while she deliberately bewitched him, the impression that she
was herself the victim of an ingenuous and involuntary passion.
In the second act her appeal to her husband would have deceived
any jury and most judges. The notes rang out with
the authentic indignation of sincerity, with the seemingly unmistakable
agony of a victim of unjust circumstance and
outrageous fortune; in that long and arduous scene, in that
tense duel, fought inch by inch between the desperate woman
and the unrelenting man, she was a gallant, a glorious fighter
in a losing battle; and at the last, when she saw the game
was lost, and she allowed her true nature to show, the spectacle
was not that of a savage beast that can do nothing but snarl
and howl, but of a gentle animal that suddenly shows ferocious
teeth and reveals a hellish hate.</p>

<p>The finest moment of the play came after this, when she
sets about her final capture of the young man and makes
him deliver her husband’s secret. When she triumphed and
said the word “<i>Vieni</i>,” it was as if one were watching some
demi-goddess, some Circe, swoop gracefully but with terrible
accuracy of aim on to her prey; swift and calm in the deadly
certainty of her stroke and of her triumph. Nobody can ever
have acted better than Duse did at that moment.</p>

<p>Duse’s performance as Césarine was the finest complete
creative work I ever saw her do—finer, in my opinion, than her
Magda, because in Magda she was too noble for the part, and
rendered none of the <i>cabotine</i> side of the character.</p>

<p>The most charming of Duse’s parts was Mirandolina in
Goldoni’s comedy, <i>La Locandiera</i>, in which she gaily twisted
all men round her fingers and played on their weaknesses as a
harper on his strings. On the same day she gave this exhibition
of gaiety, charm, rippling fun, and sly humour, the
whole as easy and spontaneous and as fresh as a melody by
Mozart, she played Lydie in Alexandre Dumas’ terrible little
masterpiece in one act, <i>La Visite de Noces</i>, and showed with
unflinching truth not realism but a Tolstoy-like reality how a
woman with despair in her soul can calmly and deliberately
unravel the skein of man’s weakness, cowardice, and infamy,
and then spit out her disgust at it.</p>

<p>In Scribe and Legouvé’s tinsel and lifeless melodrama,
<i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i>, she was wasting her talent, and indeed
in her hands the greater part of the play fell flat as far as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
is anything in it to fall flat. But in the death scene she revealed
new phases of her genius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Silver lights and darks undreamed of.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She turned the tinsel of the play into gold by her bewilderment,
when she felt the first effects of the poison, her delirium,
when she imagined herself on the lighted stage, and by her final
battle with Death, when she recovered her senses once more,
in the last moments of her agony. One gasped for breath when
she felt the first throes of the poison; and when she became
delirious, the surroundings seemed to fade; we were face to face
with a ghost; we felt the icy wind blowing from the dark river.</p>

<p>In D’Annunzio’s play, <i>La Gioconda</i>, she might have been
De Quincey’s Our Lady of Sorrows. In Sardou’s <i>Fédora</i> not all
her technical skill could supply the acid necessary to make
that particular and peculiarly constructed engine work. The
engine was made for Sarah Bernhardt, and nobody else has ever
succeeded in making it deliver the strong electric shock, the
infectious thrill that it produced when Sarah Bernhardt dealt
with it. It may not have been worth doing; but only she could
do it.</p>

<p>Looking back on all the plays in which I saw Duse act, and
on all the striking moments and scenes in those plays—her
confusion when she recognised the man who had seduced her
in <i>Magda</i>, the pathos of her death scene in <i>La Dame aux
Camélias</i>, her withering scorn in Sardou’s <i>Odette</i>, her irony
in Ibsen’s <i>Doll’s House</i>, her fiendish leer of seduction and
triumph in <i>La Femme de Claude</i>—there was one moment in one
play which impressed me more than everything else. This was
in the last act of Pinero’s <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i>, when she
looks at herself in a hand-glass and realises that when she loses
her looks she will have lost all. Duse looked in the glass, and
she passed her hand over her face. It was only a flash, a flicker;
it only lasted a second, and yet in that second her face reminded
me of the title of one of Kipling’s stories, <i>The Gate of the Hundred
Sorrows</i>. She looked suddenly, and for a second, fifty years
older, and one felt that the act of suicide with which the play
ends was not improbable, whatever else it might be—was, in
fact, inevitable.</p>

<p>Sarah Bernhardt, Duse, and Chaliapine were the three greatest
artists I have seen on the stage; for Chaliapine, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
his glorious voice and his consummate singing, is a great
actor, and his range is prodigious. He can sing one night in
<i>Ivan the Terrible</i> and freeze you to the marrow by his interpretation
of the grim, half-insane, majestic, and frenzied King;
and the next night give you a picture of calm and serene
saintliness in the part of the old Believer in <i>Khovantincha</i>;
or in the <i>Barbier de Seville</i> he can be comic with a rollicking
gusto. Perhaps his finest part is that of Mephistopheles in
Boito’s opera. When he comes on to the stage in the first act
disguised as a monk you feel that the devil is there, the Prince
of Darkness, and not a fancy-dress ball Mephistopheles; and
in the scene on the Brocken, he looks and plays as if he
were Milton’s Satan. There is a titanic grandeur about
him. He wears the pall of tragedy as easily as if it were
a dressing-gown. Like all great actors, he gives you the impression
that his acting is quite simple, an easy thing which
anyone could do. If you watch him closely, it is impossible to
detect how and when he makes a gesture or gives a look or an
intonation. It is done before you have time to see it done.
He told me once that his great desire and ambition was to play
in Shakespeare; and his <i>Boris Godounov</i>, in which he gave so
ineffaceable a picture of sombre ambition, brooding fear, and
eating remorse, indicated that he would have been magnificent
as Othello, Richard III., or Lear. The finest acting I ever saw
on the English stage were Irving’s Becket with its sublimely
dignified and impressive death-scene in the Cathedral; Ellen
Terry’s Beatrice with its inspiring pace and rippling diction—indeed,
Ellen Terry in any part, Portia, Imogen, Nance Oldfield—Sir
John Hare in <i>A Pair of Spectacles</i> and the <i>Notorious
Mrs. Ebbsmith</i>; Mrs. Kendal in <i>The Likeness of the Night</i>, and,
for imaginative character acting, Tree as Svengali. Hare had
the same seeming simplicity in his art, the same concealment
of all artifice, the same undetectable conjury that struck one
in the work of Duse, Chaliapine, Sarah Bernhardt, and all
great actors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendal acted so well, when she and her husband and Sir
John Hare used to appear regularly at the St. James’s Theatre,
and people took the excellence of her acting so much for granted,
that they tired of it. She left us. She toured in America,
and then she came back and appeared in a play called <i>The
Greatest of These</i>, at the Garrick Theatre, in June 1896; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Mr. Bernard Shaw, in his notice of the play, said: “Mrs. Kendal,
forgetting that London playgoers have been starved for years
in the matter of acting, inconsiderately gave them more in the
first ten minutes than they have had in the last five years,
with the result that the poor wretches became hysterical and
vented their applause in sobs and shrieks. And yet in the old
days at the St. James’s they would have taken it as a matter of
course and perhaps grumbled at the play into the bargain.”</p>

<p>But of all my playgoing, I think what I enjoyed most of all
was a summer troupe at the Arena Nazionale in Florence, in the
summer of 1893. The troupe was an ordinary one; but they
produced a different play every night; and I there saw nearly
all the plays worth seeing in the European repertory, including
Shakespeare, Ibsen, Dumas, Sardou, Maupassant, Sudermann—besides
many Italian plays. The seats were cheap; smoking
was allowed. The auditorium was open to the sky. The
Italians acted so naturally, and so easily, that they were more
like children improvising charades than professionals working
for their bread; and among them was an actor who made a
great name for himself later—Zacchoni. I remember that
when I came back to London and went to a play for the first
time, the diction of the English players seemed so stilted,
laborious, and artificial, after these easy, babbling Italians,
that I felt as if it was in London and not in Florence that I had
been listening to a foreign language.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer of 1905 I went back to Manchuria.
I spent a few days in St. Petersburg, and then I embarked
once more in the Transbaikalian railway. The journey was
pleasantly different from what it had been in 1904, and almost
as interesting in another way. An officer of the German
forestry, and a friend of a Hildesheim friend of mine—Erich
Wippern—was in the train. He was reading the second part of
Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>. I shared a compartment with an army doctor.
We crossed Lake Baikal in a steamer. It was blue, and there
was nothing of the ghostly unreal look about it that it wears in
the winter. Kharbin was changed beyond recognition. The
town was twice as big and seemed to be almost deserted.
General Linevitch, the new Commander-in-Chief, did not
allow officers to go there any more except on pressing errands
and for good reasons. I spent a few days there, and I got to
know some of the local officers, among others a charming General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Zacharoff who was in charge of the demobilisation. I found
myself suddenly plunged into a new society which was not
unlike what Chekhov depicts in his plays. A small drama
was progressing round the wife of a local engineer, who was
the Circe of the place. She was not particularly beautiful, but
she did what she liked with whomsoever she pleased. There
were quarrels, duels arranged, suicides threatened, revolvers
fired; the whole ending in conversation and cigarette smoke—just
as in a Chekhov play, of which the motto might have
been: “L’amour passe; la fumée reste.”</p>

<p>On 1st September peace was declared, and the soldiers
in the place tore the telegram from one another’s hands.</p>

<p>I went to Gunchuling, which was the remoter G.H.Q. of the
army, and I stayed with the Press censors. Although peace had
been declared, an officer whom I knew got orders to go and
fortify positions, and Kuropatkin’s army was said to have
received orders to advance. At the time this seemed inexplicable.
The reason of this was, I learnt a long time afterwards,
that news had been received of a revolution in Japan.</p>

<p>From Gunchuling I went to Godziadan, which was the
advanced G.H.Q. where the Commander-in-Chief lived in a
train. I had telegraphed from Gunchuling to the 2nd Transbaikal
battery, asking them to send horses to fetch me. The
battery was in Mongolia, at a place called Jen-tsen-Tung, on the
extreme right flank of the army and eighty miles from Godziadan.
Two Cossacks arrived with a pony for me and my own saddle
on it, and we started at eight o’clock in the morning on our
long and exhausting ride.</p>

<p>We spent the first night at the Chinese town of Ushitai,
and halted for our midday meal the next day at a Chinese village,
a small tumble-down place near a large clump of trees. A
Chinaman came out of the house and, seeing the red brassard of
the correspondents on my arm, thought I was a doctor. In
pidgin Russian he told me his child was ill; and leading me into
his house he showed me a brown and naked infant with a fat
stomach. The infant had a white tongue and had been feeding,
so the Chinaman told me, on raw Indian corn. I prescribed
cessation of diet, and the Chinaman seemed to be satisfied, and
asked me whether I would like to hear a concert. I said: “Very
much”; he then bade me sit down on the <i>K’ang</i> and said:
“<i>Smotri, smotri</i>” (“Look, look”). Presently another Chinaman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
came into the room, and taking from the wall a large and twisted
clarion made of brass, he blew on it one deafening blast and hung
it up on the wall again. There was a short pause. I waited in
expectation, and the Chinaman turned to me and said: “The
concert is now over.” I then went to have luncheon with the
Cossacks under the trees, the meal consisting of rusks as hard
as bricks swimming in an earthen bowl of boiling water, on the
surface of which tea was sprinkled. When we had finished our
meal, and just as we were about to start, the Chinaman in whose
house I had been entertained, rushed up to me and said: “In
your country, when you go to a concert, do you not pay for it?”
The concert was paid for, and we rode on. We rode through
grassy and flowery steppes: this was the beginning of Mongolia.
We met Mongols sitting sideways on their ponies and dressed in
coats of many colours, and we arrived at Jen-tsen-Tung at eight
o’clock. There I found my old friend Kislitski of the battery,
who was living in an immaculately clean Chinese house, and
there I dined and spent the night. The next morning I rode to
a village two miles off, where the battery was quartered. There
I stayed from the 15th of September until the 1st of October,
living a life of ease and interest. The village where we were
quartered was picturesque. It lay in a clump of willow trees,
and near it there was a large wood which stretched down to a
broad brown river. Next door to us lived a Chinaman who was
preparing three young students for their examination in Pekin.
He was an amiable and urbane scholar, and he used to put on
large horn spectacles and chant the most celebrated stop-shorts
in Chinese literature. Stop-shorts are Chinese poems in four
lines. They are called stop-shorts because the sense goes on
when the sound stops.</p>

<p>We spent the time in riding, reading, bathing, sleeping, and
playing patience.</p>

<p>Jen-tsen-Tung was a large and picturesque town; a stream
of Mongols flowed in and out of it, wearing the most picturesque
clothes—silks and velvets of deep orange and sea-green that
glowed like jewels. At one of the street corners a professional
wizard, dressed in black silk, embroidered with silver moons
and wearing a black conical hat, practised his trade. You
asked a question, paid a small sum, and he told you the answer
to the question; but he refused to prophesy for more than a
hundred days ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>The evenings in our quarters were beautiful. The sky
would have a faint pinky-mauve tinge, like a hydrangea, and a
large misty moon hung over the delicate willow trees that were
silvery and rustled faintly in the half light. From the yard
would float the sounds of music, music played on a one-stringed
instrument and accompanying a wailing song, an infinitely
melancholy music, less Oriental than Chinese music, and more
Eastern than Russian music.</p>

<p>I left this dreamy paradise on the 1st of October, and I
arrived at Kharbin on the 7th of October.</p>

<p>At Jen-tsen-Tung I had consulted the magician who practised
his arts in the street about my journey home. His answer was
that I could go home by the west or by the east; west would be
better, but I should meet with obstacles. His prophecy came
true, but the obstacles did not begin till we arrived at Samara.
I was in the Trans-Siberian express. There were on board the
train some officers, a German savant, two German men of
commerce, three Americans—who were on their way back from
Siberia, where they had managed a mine—a Polish student, and
some ladies. I shared a compartment with Alexander Dimitriev-Mamonov,
whose acquaintance I had made at Kharbin.
He was the landlord of a small property near Kirsanov. During
the war he had been employed in the Russo-Chinese Bank at
Port Arthur, where he had worked during the daytime. At
night he had served in the trenches. He spoke English perfectly,
although he had never been to England. The first part
of the journey was uneventful, and nothing of interest happened
till we arrived at Irkutsk, except that the German man of commerce
had a violent quarrel with one of the officers because he
did not take off his hat in the restaurant car, in which there was
a portrait of the Emperor. Had the German been a little better
versed in Russian law, he would have known that a recent
decree had made this salutation unnecessary; as it was, he
gave in and submitted to the incident being written down in
a protocol.</p>

<p>While we were quietly travelling, the Russian revolution
had begun. The first news of it came to me in the following
manner. We had crossed the Urals, and we had been travelling
thirteen days; we had arrived at Samara, when the attendant,
who looked after the first-class carriages, came into my compartment
and heaved a sigh. I asked him what was the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
“We shan’t get farther than Toula,” he said. “Why?” I
asked. “Because of the unpleasantnesses” (<i>niepriatnosti</i>).
I asked, “What unpleasantnesses?” “There is a mutiny,”
he said, “on the line.” We passed the big station of Sisran
and arrived at the small town of Kousnetsk, which was no bigger
than a village. There we were told the train could not go any
farther because of the strike.</p>

<p>We expected an ordinary railway strike, which would mean at
the most a delay of a few hours. We got out and walked about
the platform. By the evening the passengers began to show signs
of restlessness. Most of them sent long telegrams to various
authorities. They drew up a petition in the form of a round-robin,
which was telegraphed to the Minister of Ways and Communications,
saying that an express train full of passengers,
extremely over-tired by a long and fatiguing journey, was
waiting at Kousnetsk, and asking the Minister to be so good as to
arrange for them to proceed farther. This telegram remained
unanswered. The next day resignation seemed to come over the
company, although innumerable complaints were voiced, such
as, “Only in Russia could such a disgraceful thing happen,”
and one of the passengers suggested that Prince Kilkov’s
portrait, which was hanging in the dining-car, should be turned
face to the wall. Prince Kilkov had built the railway, and
was at that moment driving an engine himself from Moscow
to St. Petersburg, as no trains were running. He was over
seventy years old. The Polish student, who had made music
for the Americans, playing by ear the accompaniment to any
tune they whistled him, and many tunes from the repertory
of current musical comedy, played the pianoforte with exaggerated
facility and endless <i>fioriture</i> and runs. I asked an
American mechanic who was travelling with the mining managers,
whether he liked the music. He said he would like it if the
“damned hell were knocked out of it,” which was exactly my
feeling. On the second day after our arrival, my American
friends left for Samara with the intention of proceeding thence
by water to St. Petersburg. I have wondered ever since how
long the journey took them, and whether they found a steamer.
As it was, their departure was not without a comic element.
This is what happened. They were talking frankly about
the supine inertia of the Russians when faced with an emergency,
and were pointing out how different were the ever-ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
presence of mind and the instant translation of ideas into
action that marked men of their own country. They added
that they had lost no time in chartering the best horses in the
town, and were starting for Samara in an hour’s time. They
were not going to take things lying down. While they were
telling us this in the restaurant car, a minor, very minor
and rather shabby, Russian official was sitting in the corner
of the car saying nothing and drinking tea. It turned out
he had overheard and understood the conversation of the
Americans, for, when they carried their luggage to where
they expected their frisky Troika to be, it was there indeed,
but they had the mortification of seeing the little official already
inside it, galloping off and waving them a friendly farewell. They
had to be content with an inferior equipage and a later start.</p>

<p>The passengers spent the time in exploring the town,
which was somnolent and melancholy. Half of it was built
on a hill, a typical Russian village—a mass of squat brown
huts; the other half in the plain was like a village in any other
country. The idle guards and railway officials sat on the steps
of the station room whistling. Two more trains arrived—a
Red Cross train and a slow passenger train. Passengers
from these trains wandered about the platform, mixing with
the idlers from the town. A crowd of peasants, travellers,
engineers and Red Cross attendants, sauntered up and down
in loose shirts and big boots, munching sunflower seeds and
spitting out the husks till the platform was thick with
refuse. A doctor who was in our train, half a German, with
an official training and an orthodox mind, talked to the
railway servants like a father. It was wrong to strike, he
said. They should have put down their grievances on paper
and had them forwarded through the proper channels. The
officials said that would have been waste of ink and penmanship.
“I wonder they don’t kill him,” Mamonov said to me, and I
agreed. Each passenger was given a rouble a day to buy food.
The third-class passengers were given checks, in return for which
they could receive meals. However, they deprecated the plan
and said they wanted the amount in beer. They received it.
They then looted the refreshment room, broke the windows, and
took away the food. This put an end to the check system.
The feeling among the first-class passengers rose. Something
ought to be done, was the general verdict; but nobody quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
knew what. They felt that the train ought to be placed in a
safe position. The situation on the evening of the second day
began to be like that described in Maupassant’s story, <i>Boule de
Suif</i>. Nothing could be done except to explore the town of
Kousnetsk. There was a feeling in the air that the normal
conditions of life had been reversed. The railway officials and
the workmen smiled ironically, as much as to say, “It is our
turn now,” but the waiter in the restaurant car went on serving
the aristocracy, which was represented by a lady in a tweed coat
and skirt, and two old gentlemen, first. The social order might
be overturned, but, though empires might crash and revolutions
convulse the world, he was not going to forget his place.</p>

<p>It was warm autumn weather. The roads were soft and
muddy, and there was a smell of rotting leaves in the air. It
was damp and grey, with gleams of weak, pitiful sunshine. In
the middle of the town there was a large market-place, where a
brisk trade in geese was carried on. One man whom I watched
failed to sell his geese during the day, and while driving them
home at sunset talked to them as if they were dogs, saying:
“Cheer up, we shall soon be home.” A party of convicts who
belonged to the passenger train were working not far from the
station, and asked the passers-by for cigarettes, which were
freely given to the “unfortunates,” as convicts were called in
Russia. I met them near the station, and they at once said:
“Give the unfortunates something.” Towards evening, in
one of the third-class carriages, a party of Little Russians, Red
Cross orderlies, sang together in parts, and sometimes in rough
counterpoint, melancholy, beautiful songs with a strange
trotting rhythm with no end and no beginning, or rather ending
on the dominant as if to begin again, and opposite their carriage
on the platform a small crowd of <i>muzhiks</i> gathered together
and listened and praised the singing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day after we had arrived, the
impatience of the passengers increased to fever pitch. A Colonel,
who was with us and who knew how to use the telegraph,
communicated with Pensa, the next big station. Although
the telegraph clerks were on strike, they remained in the offices
talking to their friends on the wire all over Russia. The strikers
were civil. They said they had no objection to the express
going farther; that they would neither boycott nor beat anyone
who took us, and that if we could find a friend to drive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
engine, well and good. We found a friend, an amateur engine-driver,
who was willing to take us, and on the 28th of October
we started for Pensa. We had not gone far before the engine
broke down. Directly this happened all the passengers offered
advice about the mending of it. One man produced a piece of
string for the purpose. But another engine was found, and we
arrived at last at Pensa. There, I saw in the telegrams the
words “rights of speech and assembly,” and I knew that the
strike was a revolution. At Pensa the anger of the soldiers
whose return home from the Far East had been delayed was
indescribable. They were lurching about the station in a state
of drunken frenzy, using unprintable language about strikes
and strikers.</p>

<p>We spent the night at Pensa. The next morning we started
for Moscow, but the train came to a dead stop at two o’clock
the next morning at Riazhk, and when I woke up, the attendant
came and said we should go no farther until the <i>unpleasantnesses</i>
were over. But an hour later news came that we could go to
Riazan in another train. Riazan Station was guarded by
soldiers. A train was ready to start for Moscow, but one had
to join in a fierce scrimmage to get a place in it. I found a
place in a third-class carriage. Opposite me was an old man
with a grey beard. He attracted my attention by his courtesy.
He gently prevented a woman with many bundles being
turned out of the train by another <i>muzhik</i>. I asked him where
he had come from. “Eighty versts the other side of Irkutsk,”
he said. “I was sent there, and now after thirteen years I am
returning home at the Government’s expense. I was a convict.”
“What were you sent there for?” I asked. “Murder!” he
answered softly. The other passengers asked him to tell
his story. “It’s a long story,” he said. “Tell it!” shouted
the other passengers. His story was this. He had got drunk,
set fire to a barn, and when the owner had interfered he killed
him. He had served a sentence of two years’ hard labour and
eleven years of exile. He was a gentle, humble creature, with
a mild expression, and he looked like an apostle. He had no
money, and lived on what the passengers gave him. I gave
him a cigarette. He smoked a quarter of it, and said he would
keep the rest for the journey, as he had still three hundred miles
to travel. We arrived at Moscow at 11 o’clock in the evening
and found the town in darkness, save for a glimmer of oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
lamps. The next morning we woke up to find that Russia
had been given a charter which contained not a Constitution,
as many so rashly took for granted, but the promise of Constitutional
Government.</p>

<p>I stayed at the Hôtel Dresden, which when I arrived was
still without lamps or light of any kind, and the lift was not
working.</p>

<p>The first thing which brought home to me that Russia had
been granted the promise of a Constitution was this. I went
to the big Russian baths. Somebody came in and asked for
some soap, upon which the barber’s assistant, aged about ten,
said, with the air of a Hampden: “Give the <i>citizen</i> some soap”
(“<i>Daite grazhdaninu mwilo</i>”). Coming out of the baths I found
the streets decorated with flags and everybody in a state of
frantic and effervescing enthusiasm. I went to one of the big
restaurants. There old men were embracing each other and
drinking the first glass of vodka to free Russia. After luncheon
I went out into the theatre square. There is a fountain in it,
which forms an excellent public platform. An orator mounted
it and addressed the crowd. He began to read the Emperor’s
Manifesto. Then he said: “We are all too much used to the
rascality of the Autocracy to believe this; down with the
Autocracy!” The crowd, infuriated—they were evidently
expecting an enthusiastic eulogy—cried: “Down with you!”
But instead of attacking the speaker who had aroused their
indignation they ran away from him! It was a curious sight.
The spectators on the pavement were seized with panic and
ran too. The orator, seeing his speech had missed fire, changed
his tone and said: “You have misunderstood me.” But what
he had said was perfectly clear. This speaker was an ordinary
Hyde Park orator. University professors spoke from the same
platform. Later in the afternoon a procession of students
arrived opposite my hotel with red flags and collected
outside the Governor-General’s house. The Governor-General
appeared on the balcony and made a speech, in which he said
that now there were no police he hoped that they would be able
to keep order themselves. He asked them also to exchange the
red flag, which was hanging on the lamp-post opposite the
Palace, for the national flag. One little student climbed like
a monkey up the lamp-post and hung a national flag there,
but did not remove the red flag. Then the Governor asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
them to sing the National Anthem, which they did; and as
they went away they sang the “Marseillaise”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On peut très bien jouer ces deux airs à la fois</div>
<div class="verse">Et cela fait un air qui fait sauver les rois!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At one moment a Cossack arrived, but an official came out
of the house and told him he was not needed, upon which he
went away, amidst the jeers, cheers, hoots, and whistling of
the crowd. On the whole, the day passed off quietly.
There were some tragic incidents: the death of a woman,
the wounding of a student and a workman who tried to rescue
the student from the prisoners’ van, and the shooting of a
veterinary surgeon called Bauman.</p>

<p>While I was standing on the steps of the hotel in the afternoon
a woman rushed up frantically and said the Black Gang
were coming. A student who came from a good family and
who was standing by explained that the Black Gang were roughs
who supported the autocracy. His hand, which was bandaged,
had been severely hurt by a Cossack, who had struck it with his
whip, thinking he was about to make a disturbance. He came
up to my room, and from the hotel window we had a good view
of the crowd, which proceeded to</p>

<div class="verse indent8">“Attaquer la Marseillaise en la</div>

<div class="verse">En mi bémol: ‘Veillons an salut de l’Empire!’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That night I dined at the Métropole Restaurant, and a
strange scene occurred. At the end of dinner the band played
the “Marseillaise,” and after it the National Anthem. Everybody
stood up except one mild-looking man with spectacles,
who went on calmly eating his dinner; upon which a man
who was sitting at the other end of the room, rather drunk,
rushed up to him and began to pull him about and drag
him to his feet. He made a display of passive resistance, which
proved effectual, and when he had finished his dinner he went
away.</p>

<p>The outward aspect of the town during these days was
strange. Moscow was like a besieged city. Many of the shops
had great wooden shutters. Some of the doors were marked
with a large red cross. The distress, I was told, during the
strike had been terrible. There was no light, no gas, no water;
all the shops were shut; provisions and wood were scarce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
On the afternoon of 2nd November I went to see Bauman’s
funeral procession, which I witnessed from many parts of the
town. It was an impressive sight. A hundred thousand men
took part in it. The whole of the <i>Intelligentsia</i> was in the
streets or at the windows. The windows and balconies were
crowded with people. Order was perfect. There was not a
hitch nor a scuffle. The men walking in the procession were
students, doctors, workmen—people in various kinds of uniform.
There were ambulances, with doctors dressed in white in them,
in case there should be casualties. The men carried great red
banners, and the coffin was covered with a scarlet pall. As
they marched they sang in a low chant the “Marseillaise,”
“Viechni Pamiat,” and the “Funeral March”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of the fighters
for freedom. This last tune is most impressive. From a
musician’s point of view it is, I am told, a bad tune; but then,
as Du Maurier said, one should never listen to musicians on the
subject of music any more than one should listen to wine merchants
on the subject of wine. But it is the tune which to my
mind exactly expressed the Russian Revolution, with its dogged
melancholy and invincible passion. It was as befitting as the
“Marseillaise” (which, by the way, the Russians sang in parts
and slowly) was inappropriate. The “Funeral March” had
nothing defiant in it; but it is one of those tunes which, when
sung by a multitude, makes the flesh creep; it is commonplace,
if you will; and it expresses—as if by accident—the
commonplaceness of all that is determined and unflinching,
mingled with an accent of weary pathos. As it grew dark,
torches were brought out, lighting up the red banners and the
scarlet coffin of the unknown veterinary surgeon, who in a
second, by a strange freak of chance, had become a hero, or
rather a symbol; an emblem and a banner, and who was being
carried to his last resting-place with a simplicity which eclipsed
the pomp of royal funerals, and to the sound of a low song
of tired but indefatigable sadness, stronger and more formidable
than the pæans which celebrate the triumphs of kings.</p>

<p>The impression left on my mind by this funeral was deep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
As I saw these hundred thousand men march past so quietly,
so simply, in their bourgeois clothes, singing in careless, almost
conversational, fashion, I seemed nevertheless to hear the
“tramping of innumerable armies,” and to feel the breath
of the—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Courage never to submit or yield,</div>
<div class="verse">And what is else not to be overcome.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After Bauman’s funeral, which had passed off without an incident,
at eleven o’clock a number of students and doctors were
shot in front of the University, as they were on their way home,
by Cossacks, who were stationed in the Riding School, opposite
the University. The Cossacks fired without orders. They
were incensed, as many of the troops were, by the display of
red flags, and the processions.</p>

<p>The day after Bauman’s funeral (3rd November) was the
anniversary of the Emperor’s accession, and all the “hooligans”
of the city, who were now called the “Black Gang,” used the
opportunity to make counter demonstrations under the ægis
of the national flag. The students did nothing; they were in
no way aggressive; but the hooligans when they came across
students beat them and in some cases killed them. The
police did nothing; they seemed to have disappeared. These
hooligans paraded the town in small groups, sometimes uniting,
blocking the traffic, demanding money from well-dressed people,
wounding students, and making themselves generally objectionable.
When the police were appealed to they shrugged their
shoulders and said: “Liberty.” The hooligans demanded
the release of the man who had killed Bauman. “They have
set free so many of their men,” they said, referring to the revolutionaries,
“we want our man set free.” The town was in
a state of anarchy; anybody could kill anyone else with impunity.
In one of the biggest streets a hooligan came up to
a man and asked him for money; he gave him ten kopecks.
“Is that all?” said the hooligan. “Take that,” and he killed
him with a Finnish knife. I was myself stopped by a band on
the Twerskaia and asked politely to contribute to their fund—the
fund of the “Black Gang”—which I did with considerable
alacrity. Students, or those whom they considered to be
students in disguise, were the people they mostly attacked.
The citizens of the town in general soon began to think that
this state of things was intolerable, and vigorous representations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
were made to the town Duma that some steps should be taken
to put an end to it. The hooligans broke the windows of the
Hôtel Métropole and those of several shops. Liberty meant to
them doing as much damage as they pleased. This state of
things lasted three days, and then it was stopped—utterly and
completely stopped. A notice was published forbidding all
demonstrations in the streets with flags. The police reappeared,
and everything resumed its normal course. These bands of
hooligans were small and easy to deal with. The disorders
were unnecessary. But they did some good in one way:
they brought home to everybody the necessity for order and
the maintenance of order, and the plain fact that removal of
the police meant anarchy.</p>

<p>In spite of all this storm and stress the theatres were doing
business as usual, and at the Art Theatre I saw a fine and
moving performance of Tchekov’s <i>Chaika</i> and also of Ibsen’s
<i>Ghosts</i>. On 7th November I went to see a new play by Gorky,
which was produced at the Art Theatre. It was called <i>The
Children of the Sun</i>. It was the second night that it had been
performed. M. Stanislavsky, one of the chief actors of the
troupe and the stage manager, gave me his place. The theatre
was crammed. There is a scene in the play where a doctor,
living in a Russian village, and devoting his life to the welfare
of the peasants, is suspected of having caused an outbreak
of cholera. The infuriated peasants pursue the doctor and
bash someone on the head. On the first night this scene
reduced a part of the audience to hysterics. It was too
“actual.” People said they saw enough of their friends killed
in the streets without going to the play for such a sight. On the
second night it was said that the offensive scene had been suppressed.
I did not quite understand what had been eliminated.
As I saw the scene it was played as follows: A roar is heard as
of an angry crowd. Then the doctor runs into a house and hides.
The master of the house protests; a peasant flies at his throat
and half strangles him until he is beaten on the head by another
peasant who belongs to the house. The play was full of interesting
moments, and was played with finished perfection.
But Gorky had not Tchekov’s talent of representing on the
stage the uneventful passage of time, the succession of the seemingly
insignificant incidents of people’s everyday lives, chosen
with such skill, depicted with such an instinct for mood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
atmosphere that the result is enthrallingly interesting. Gorky’s
plays have the faults and qualities of his stories. They are unequal,
but contain moments of poignant interest and vividness.</p>

<p>The next night (8th November) I went to St. Petersburg.
There I saw Spring-Rice, Dr. Dillon, and heard <i>Fidelio</i> at the
opera. The young lions in the gallery did not realise that
<i>Fidelio</i> is a revolutionary opera and the complete expression
of the “Liberation movement” in Germany.</p>

<p>A Post Office strike, followed by a strike of other unions,
was going on, and one night while I was at the Opéra Bouffe,
where the <i>Country Girl</i> was being given, the electric light went
out. The performance continued all the same, the actors
holding bedroom candles in their hands, while the auditorium
remained in the dimmest of twilights.</p>

<p>I stayed in St. Petersburg till the 21st of November, when
I went to London. I travelled to the frontier with a Japanese
Military Attaché and a Russian student. We three passengers
had a curious conversation. The Japanese gentleman rarely
spoke, but he nodded civilly, and made a sneezing noise every
now and then. The student talked of English literature with
warm enthusiasm. His two favourite English modern authors
were Jerome K. Jerome and Oscar Wilde. When I showed
some surprise at this choice, he said I probably only thought
of Jerome as a comic author. I said that was the case.
“Then,” he said, “you have not read <i>Paul Kelver</i>, which is
a masterpiece, a real human book—a great book.”</p>

<p>When we got out at the frontier the Japanese officer wanted
to fetch something but as there was no porter in sight, was
loath to leave his bag. The student offered to keep watch
over it, but the Japanese would not trust him to do this, and
stood by his bag till a porter arrived. The student was
astonished and slightly hurt.</p>

<p>After I had stayed a little over a fortnight in London I
went back first to St. Petersburg, then to Moscow.</p>

<p>I had not been two days in Moscow before there was
another strike. It began on Wednesday, the 20th of December,
punctually at midday. The lift ceased working in the hotel,
the electric light was turned off, and I laid in a large store of
books and cigarettes against coming events. The strike was
said to be an answer to the summary proceedings of the Government
and its action in arresting leaders of the revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
committee. Its watchword was to be: “A Constituent
Assembly based upon universal suffrage.” Beyond the electric
light going out, nothing happened on this day. On Thursday,
the 21st, most of the shops began to shut. The man who
cleaned the boots in the hotel made the following remark:
“I now understand that the people exercise great power.” I
heard a shot fired somewhere from the hotel at nine o’clock
in the evening. I asked the hall porter whether the theatres
were open. He said they were shut, and added: “And who
would dream of going to the theatre in these times of stress?”</p>

<p>The next day I drove with Marie Karlovna von Kotz into
the country to a village called Chernaya, about twenty-five
versts from Moscow on the Novgorod road, which before the
days of railways was famous for its highway robberies and
assaults on the rich merchants by the hooligans of that day.
We drove in a big wooden sledge drawn by two horses, the
coachman standing up all the while. We went to visit two
old maids, who were peasants and lived in the village. One
of them had got stranded in Moscow, and, owing to the railway
strike, was unable to go back again, and so we took her with
us; otherwise she would have walked home. We started
at 10.30 and arrived at 1.30. The road was absolutely still—a
thick carpet of snow, upon which fresh flakes drifting in
the fitful gusts of wind fell gently. Looking at the drifting
flakes which seemed to be tossed about in the air, the first
old maid said that a man’s life was like a snowflake in the
wind, and that she had never thought she would go home
with us on her sister’s name-day.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the village we found a meal ready for
us, which, although the fast of Advent was being strictly
observed and the food made with fasting butter, was far from
jejune. It consisted of pies with rice and cabbage inside,
and cold fish and tea and jam, and some vodka for me—the
guest. The cottage consisted of one room and two very small
ante-rooms—the walls, floors, and ceilings of plain deal. Five
or six rich ikons hung in the corner of the room, and a coloured
oleograph of Father John of Kronstadt on one of the walls.
A large stove heated the room. Soon some guests arrived
to congratulate old maid No. 2 on her name-day, and after
a time the pope entered, blessed the room, and sat down to
tea. We talked of the strike, and how quiet the country was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and of the hooligans in the town. “No,” said the pope, with
gravity, “we have our own hooligans.” A little later the
village schoolmaster arrived, who looked about twenty years
old, and was a little tiny man with a fresh face and gold-rimmed
spectacles, with his wife, who, like the æsthetic lady in Gilbert
and Sullivan’s <i>Patience</i>, was “massive.” I asked the pope
if I could live unmolested in this village. He said: “Yes;
but if you want to work you won’t be quiet in this house,
because your two hostesses chatter and drink tea all day
and all night.” At three o’clock we thought we had better
be starting home; it was getting dark, the snow was falling
heavily. The old maids said we couldn’t possibly go. We
should (1) lose our way; (2) be robbed by tramps; (3) be
massacred by strikers on the railway line; (4) not be allowed
to enter the town; (5) be attacked by hooligans when we reached
the dark streets. We sent for Vassili, the coachman, to consult
with him. “Can you find your way home?” we asked.
“Yes, I can,” he said. “Shall we lose our way?” “We
might lose our way—it happens,” he said slowly—“it happens
times and again; but we might not—it often doesn’t happen.”
“Might we be attacked on the way?” “We might—it
happens—they attack; but we might not—sometimes they
don’t attack.” “Are the horses tired?” “Yes, the horses
are tired.” “Then we had better not go.” “The horses
can go all right,” he said. Then we thought we would stay;
but Vassili said that his master would curse him if he stayed
unless we “added” something.</p>

<p>So we settled to stay, and the schoolmaster took us to see
the village school, which was clean, roomy, and altogether
an excellent home of learning. Then he took us to a neighbouring
factory which had not struck, and in which he presided
over a night class for working men and women. From here
we telephoned to Moscow, and learned that everything was
quiet in the city. I talked to one of the men in the factory
about the strike. “It’s all very well for the young men,” one
of them said; “they are hot-headed and like striking; but we
have to starve for a month. That’s what it means.” Then
we went to the school neighbouring the factory where the night
class was held. There were two rooms—one for men, presided
over by the schoolmaster; and one for women, presided over
by his wife. They had a lesson of two hours in reading, writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and arithmetic. The men came to be taught in separate
batches, one batch coming one week, one another. This
day there were five men and two boys and six women. The
men were reading a story about a bear—rather a tedious tale.
“Yes, we are reading,” one of them said to me, “and we
understand some of it.” That was, at any rate, consoling.
They read to themselves first, then aloud in turn, standing up,
and then they were asked to tell what they had read in their
own words. They read haltingly, with difficulty grasping
familiar words. They related fluently, except one man, who
said he could remember nothing whatsoever about the doings
of the bear. One little boy was doing with lightning rapidity
those kinds of sums which, by giving you too many data and
not enough—a superabundance of detail, leaving out the all
that seems to be imperatively necessary—are to some minds
peculiarly insoluble. The sum in question stated that a
factory consisted of 770 hands—men, women, and children—and
that the men received half as much again as the women, etc.
That particular proportion of wages seems to exist in the
arithmetic books of all countries, to the despair of the non-mathematical,
and the little boy insisted on my following
every step of his process of reckoning; but not even he with
the wisdom and sympathy of babes succeeded in teaching me
how to do that kind of sum. He afterwards wrote in a copybook
pages of declensions of Russian nouns and adjectives.
Here I found I could help him, and I saved him some trouble
by dictating them to him; though every now and then we had
some slight doubt and discussion about the genitive plural.
In the women’s class, one girl explained to us, with tears in
her eyes, how difficult it was for her to attend this class. Her
fellow-workers laughed at her for it, and at home they told
her that a woman’s place was to be at work and not to meddle
with books. Those who attended this school showed that they
were really anxious to learn, as the effort and self-sacrifice
needed were great.</p>

<p>We stayed till the end of the lesson, and then we went home,
where an excellent supper of eggs, etc., was awaiting us. We
found the two old maids and their first cousin, who told us she
was about to go to law for a legacy of 100,000 roubles which had
been left her, but which was disputed by a more distant relation
on the mother’s side. We talked of lawsuits and politics and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
miracles, and real and false faith-healers, till bedtime came.
A bed was made for me alongside of the stove. Made is the
right word, for it was literally built up before my eyes. A
sleeping-place was also made for the coachman on the floor of
the small ante-room; then the rest of the company disappeared
to sleep. I say disappeared, because I literally do not know
where in this small interior there was room for them to sleep.
They consisted of the two old maids, their niece and her little
girl, aged three, and another little girl, aged seven. Marie
Karlovna slept in the room, but the rest disappeared, I suppose
on the top of the stove, only it seemed to reach the ceiling;
somewhere they were, for the little girl, excited by the events
of the day, sang snatches of song till a late hour in the night.
The next morning, after I got up, the room was transformed
from a bedroom into a dining-room and aired, breakfast was
served, and at ten we started back again in the snow to
Moscow.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we arrived in the town at one o’clock. The
streets of the suburbs seemed to be unusually still. Marie
Karlovna said to me: “How quiet the streets are, but it seems
to me an uncanny, evil quietness.” Marie Karlovna lived in
the Lobkovsky Pereulok, and I had the day before sent my
things from the hotel to an apartment in the adjoining street,
the Mwilnikov. When we arrived at the entrance of these
streets, we found them blocked by a crowd and guarded by
police and dragoons. We got through the other end of the
street, and we were told that the night before Fiedler’s School,
which was a large building at the corner of these two streets, had
been the scene of a revolutionary meeting; that the revolutionaries
had been surrounded in this house, had refused to surrender,
had thrown a bomb at an officer and killed him, had been fired
at by artillery, and had surrendered after killing 1 officer
and 5 men, with 17 casualties—15 wounded and 2 killed.
All this had happened in my very street during my absence.
An hour later we again heard a noise of guns, and an armed
rising (some of the leaders of which, who were to have seized the
Governor-General of the town and set up a provisional Government,
had been arrested the night before in my street) had
broken out in all parts of the town in spite of the arrests. A
little later I saw a crowd of people on foot and in sledges flying
in panic down the street shouting: “Kazaki!” I heard and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
nothing else of any interest during the day. There were crowds
of people in the streets till nightfall.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Christmas Eve, I drove to the Hôtel Dresden
in the centre of Moscow to see Mamonov. The aspect of the
town was extraordinary. The streets were full of people—<i>flâneurs</i>
who were either walking about or gathered together in
small or large groups at the street comers. Distant, and sometimes
quite near, sounds of firing were audible, and nobody seemed
to care a scrap; they were everywhere talking, discussing, and
laughing. Imagine the difference between this and the scenes
described in Paris during the street fighting in ’32, ’48, and ’71.</p>

<p>People went about their business just as usual. If there
was a barricade they drove round it. The cabmen never dreamt
of not going anywhere, although one of them said to me that
it was most alarming. Moreover, an insuperable curiosity
seemed to lead them to go and look where things were happening.
Several were killed in this way. On the other hand, at
the slightest approach of troops they ran in panic like hares,
although the troops did not do the passers-by any mischief.
Two or three times I was walking in the streets when dragoons
galloped past, and came to no harm. We heard shots all the time,
and met the same groups of people and passed two barricades.
The barricades were mostly not like those of the Faubourg
St. Antoine, but small impediments made of branches and an
overturned sledge; they were put there to annoy and wear out
the troops and not to stand siege. The revolutionaries adopted
a guerilla street warfare. They fired or threw bombs and
rapidly dispersed; they made some attempts to seize the
Nikolayev Railway Station, but in all cases they were repulsed.
The attitude of the man in the street was curious; sometimes
he was indignant with the strikers, sometimes indignant with
the Government. If you asked a person of revolutionary
sympathies he told you that sympathy was entirely with the
revolution; if you asked a person of moderate principles, he told
you that the “people” were indignant with the strikers; but
the attitude of the average man in the street seemed to me one
of sceptical indifference in spite of all—in spite of trade ceasing,
houses being fired at, and the hospitals being full to overflowing
of dead and wounded. The fact was that disorders had lost their
first power of creating an impression; they had become an
everyday occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are various remarks I heard. One man, a commissionaire,
asked whether I thought it was right to fire on the
revolutionaries. I hesitated, gathering my thoughts to explain
that I thought that they thoroughly deserved it since they
began it, but that the Government nevertheless had brought
it about by their dilatoriness. (This is exactly what I thought.)
Misunderstanding my hesitation, he said: “Surely you, a
<i>foreigner</i>, need not mind saying what you think, and you know
it is wrong.” (This was curious, because these people—commissionaires,
porters, etc.—were often reactionary.) A
cabman said to me: “Who do you think will get the best of
it?” I said: “I don’t know; what do you think?” “Nothing
will come of it,” he said. “There will still be rich people like
you and poor people like me; and whether the Government
is in the hands of the <i>chinovniks</i> or the students is all one and
the same.” Another man, a porter, an ex-soldier, said it was
awful. You couldn’t go anywhere or drive anywhere without
risking being killed. Soldiers came back from the war and
were killed in the streets. A bullet came, and then the man was
done for. Another man, a kind of railway employee, said that
the Russians had no stamina; that the Poles would never give
in, but the Russians would directly. Mamonov, who was fond
of paradox, said to me that he hoped all the fanatics would
be shot, and that then the Government would be upset. A
policeman was guarding the street which led to the hotel. I
asked if I could pass. “How could I not let a Barine with
whom I am acquainted pass?” he said. Then a baker’s boy
came up with a tray of rolls on his head, also asking to pass—to
go to the hotel. After some discussion the policeman let
him go, but suddenly said: “Or are you a rascal?” Then I
asked him what he thought of it all. He said: “We fire as little
as possible. They are fools.” The wealthier and educated
classes were either intensely sympathetic or violently indignant
with the revolutionaries; the lower classes were sceptically
resigned or indifferent—“Things are bad; nothing will come
of it for us.”</p>

<p>At midnight the windows of our house had been shaken by
the firing of guns somewhere near; but on Christmas morning
(not the Russian Christmas) one could get about. I drove
down one of the principal streets, the Kuznetski Most, into
another large street, the Neglinii Proiesd (as if it were down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Bond Street into Piccadilly), when suddenly in a flash all the
cabs began to drive fast up the street. My cabman went on.
He was inquisitive. We saw nothing. He shouted to another
cabman, asking him what was the matter. No answer. We
went a little farther down, when along the Neglinii Proiesd we
saw a patrol and guns advancing. “Go back,” shouted one of
the soldiers, waving his rifle—and away we went. Later, I
believe there was firing there. Farther along we met more
patrols and ambulances. The shops were not only shut but
boarded up.</p>

<p>Next day I walked to the Nikolayev Station in the afternoon.
It was from there that the trains went to St. Petersburg. The
trains were running then, but how the passengers started I
didn’t know, for it was impossible to get near the station. Cabs
were galloping away from it, and the square in front of it had
been cleared by Cossacks. I think it was attacked that afternoon.
I walked into the Riask Station, which was next door.
It was a scene of desolation; empty trains, stacked-up luggage,
third-class passengers encamped in the waiting-room. There
was a perpetual noise of firing. The town was under martial
law. Nobody was allowed to be out of doors after nine
o’clock under penalty of three months’ imprisonment or a 3000
roubles fine. Householders were made responsible for people
firing out of their windows.</p>

<p>On the morning of 27th December there was considerable
movement and traffic in the streets; the small shops and
the tobacconists were open. Firing was still going on. They
said a factory was being attacked. The troops who were supposed
to be disaffected proved loyal. The one way to make
them loyal was to throw bombs at them. The policemen were
then armed with rifles and bayonets. A cabman said to me:
“There is an illness abroad—we are sick; it will pass—but God
remains.” I agreed with him.</p>

<span class="smaller">RUSSIA: THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

<p>I spent all the winter of 1905-6 at Moscow with occasional
visits to St. Petersburg and to the country. The
strikes were over, but it was in a seething, restless
state. Count Witte was Prime Minister. When he took office
after making peace with the Japanese he was idolised as a
hero, but he soon lost his popularity and his prestige. He satisfied
neither the revolutionaries nor the reactionaries, and he
was neither King Log nor King Stork. Elections were held
in the spring for the convening of the Duma, the first Russian
Parliament, but they were not looked upon with confidence and
they were boycotted by the more extreme parties. Russia
was swarming with political parties, but of all these divisions
and subdivisions, each with its programme and its watchword,
there were only two which had any importance: the Constitutional
Democrats called Kadets,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which represented the
<i>Intelligentsia</i>, and the Labour Party, which represented the
artisans and out of which the Bolsheviks were ultimately to
grow. The peasants stood aloof, and remained separate.</p>

<p>None of these parties produced either a statesman or remarkable
man. There were any amount of clever men and fine
orators in their ranks, but no man of action.</p>

<p>A man of action did ultimately appear, but in the ranks of
the Government—P. A. Stolypin—and he governed Russia for
several years, till he was murdered.</p>

<p>At Moscow I had two little rooms in the Mwilnikov pereulok
on the ground floor. I was now a regular correspondent to the
<i>Morning Post</i>, and used to send them a letter once a week.
Their St. Petersburg correspondent was Harold Monro, who
wrote fiction under the pseudonym of “Saki.”</p>

<p>The stories that Monro wrote under the name of “Saki” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> and the <i>Morning Post</i> attracted when they
came out in these newspapers, and afterwards when they were
republished, a considerable amount of attention; but because
they were witty, light, and ironical, and sometimes flippant, few
people took “Saki” seriously as an artist. I venture to think
he was an artist of a high order, and had his stories reached
the public from Vienna or Paris, there would have been an
artistic boom round his work of a deafening nature.</p>

<p>As it is, people dismissed him as a funny writer. Funny he
was, both in his books and in his conversation; irresistibly
witty and droll sometimes, sometimes ecstatically silly, so that
he made you almost cry for laughter, but he was more than
that—he was a thoughtful and powerful satirist, an astonishing
observer of human nature, with the power of delineating the
pathos and the irony underlying the relations of human beings
in everyday life, with exquisite delicacy and a strong sureness
of touch. A good example of his wit is his answer when a lady
asked him how his book could be got: “Not at an ironmonger’s.”
His satire is seen at its strongest in the fantasy, <i>When William
Came</i>, in which he describes England under German domination,
but the book in which his many gifts and his intuition
for human things are mingled in the finest blend is perhaps
<i>The Unbearable Bassington</i>, which is a masterpiece of character-drawing,
irony, and pathos. And yet in literary circles in
London, or at dinner-parties where you would hear people rave
over some turgid piece of fiction, that because it was sordid was
thought to be profound, and would probably be forgotten in
a year’s time, you would never have heard “Saki” mentioned
as an artist to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>“No one will buy,” as the seller of gold-fish remarked at
the fair—“no one will buy the little gold-fish, for men do not
recognise the gifts of Heaven, the magical gifts, when they
meet them.”</p>

<p>Nobody sought the suffrages of the literary and artistic
circle less than “Saki.” I think he would have been pleased
with genuine serious recognition, as every artist would be,
but the false <i>réclame</i> and the chatter of coteries bored him to
extinction.</p>

<p>In 1914 he showed what he was really made of by enlisting
in the army, and he was killed in the war as a corporal after he
had several times refused a commission.</p>

<p>I spent Easter in Moscow, and this was one of the most
impressive experiences I ever had.</p>

<p>I have spent Easter in various cities—in Rome, Florence,
Athens, and Hildesheim—and although in each of these places
the feast has its own peculiar aspect, yet by far the most impressive
and the most interesting celebration of the Easter festival
I have ever witnessed was that of Moscow. This is not to be
wondered at, for Easter is the most important feast of the year
in Russia, the season of festivity and holiday-making in a
greater degree than Christmas or New Year’s Day. Secondly,
Easter, which is kept with equal solemnity all over Russia,
was especially interesting in Moscow, because Moscow is the
stronghold of old traditions and the city of churches. Even
more than Cologne, it is</p>

<p class="noindent">There is a church almost in every street, and the Kremlin is a
citadel of cathedrals. During Holy Week, towards the end of
which the evidences of the fasting season grow more and more
obvious by the closing of restaurants and the impossibility of
buying any wine and spirits, there were, of course, services
every day. During the first three days of Holy Week there
was a curious ceremony to be seen in the Kremlin, which was
held every two years. This was the preparation of the chrism
or holy oil. While it was slowly stirred and churned in great
cauldrons, filling the room with hot fragrance, a deacon read
the Gospel without ceasing (he was relieved at intervals by
others), and this lasted day and night for three days. On
Maundy Thursday the chrism was removed in silver vessels to
the Cathedral. The supply had to last the whole of Russia
for two years. I went to the morning service in the Cathedral
of the Assumption on Maundy Thursday. The church was
crowded to suffocation. Everybody stood up, as there was no
room to kneel. The church was lit with countless small wax
tapers. The priests were clothed in white and silver. The
singing of the noble plain chant without any accompaniment
ebbed and flowed in perfect discipline; the bass voices were
unequalled in the world. Every class of the population was
represented in the church. There were no seats, no pews,
no precedence nor privilege. There was a smell of incense and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a still stronger smell of poor people, without which, someone
said, a church is not a church. On Good Friday there was the
service of the Holy Shroud, and besides this a later service in
which the Gospel was read out in fourteen different languages,
and finally a service beginning at one o’clock in the morning
and ending at four, to commemorate the Burial of Our Lord.
How the priests endured the strain of these many and exceedingly
long services was a thing to be wondered at; for the fast,
which was kept strictly during all this period, precluded butter,
eggs, and milk, in addition to all the more solid forms of nourishment,
and the services were about six times as long as those of
the Catholic or other churches.</p>

<p>The most solemn service of the year took place at midnight
on Saturday in Easter week. From eight until ten o’clock
the town, which during the day had been crowded with people
buying provisions and presents and Easter eggs, seemed to be
asleep and dead. At about ten people began to stream towards
the Kremlin. At eleven o’clock there was already a dense
crowd, many of the people holding lighted tapers, waiting
outside in the square, between the Cathedral of the Assumption
and that of Ivan Veliki. A little before twelve the cathedrals
and palaces on the Kremlin were all lighted up with ribbons of
various coloured lights. Twelve o’clock struck, and then the
bell of Ivan Veliki began to boom: a beautiful, full-voiced,
immense volume of sound—a sound which Clara Schumann said
was the most beautiful she had ever heard. It was answered
by other bells, and a little later all the bells of all the
churches in Moscow were ringing together. Then from the
Cathedral came the procession: first, the singers in crimson
and gold; the bearers of the gilt banners; the Metropolitan,
also in stiff vestments of crimson and gold; and after him the
officials in their uniforms. They walked round the Cathedral
to look for the Body of Our Lord, and returned to the Cathedral
to tell the news that He was risen. The guns went off, rockets
were fired, and illuminations were seen across the river, lighting
up the distant cupola of the great Church of the Saviour
with a cloud of fire.</p>

<p>The crowd began to disperse and to pour into the various
churches. I went to the Manège—an enormous riding school,
in which the Ekaterinoslav Regiment had its church. Half the
building looked like a fair. Long tables, twinkling with hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of wax tapers, were loaded with the three articles of food
which were eaten at Easter—a huge cake called <i>kulich</i>; a kind
of sweet cream made of curds and eggs, cream and sugar, called
<i>Paskha</i> (Easter); and Easter eggs, dipped and dyed in many
colours. They were waiting to be blessed. The church itself
was a tiny little recess on one side of the building. There the
priests were officiating, and down below in the centre of the
building the whole regiment was drawn up. There were two
services—a service which began at midnight and lasted about
half an hour; and Mass, which followed immediately after it,
lasting till about three in the morning. At the end of the first
service, when the words, “Christ is risen,” were sung, the
priest kissed the deacon three times, and then the members of
the congregation kissed each other, one person saying, “Christ
is risen,” and the other answering, “He is risen, indeed.” The
colonel kissed the sergeant; the sergeant kissed all the men
one after another. While this ceremony was proceeding, I
left and went to the Church of the Saviour, where the first
service was not yet over. Here the crowd was so dense that
it was almost impossible to get into the church, although it
was immense. The singing in this church was ineffable. I
waited until the end of the first service, and then I was borne
by the crowd to one of the narrow entrances and hurled through
the doorway outside. The crowd was not rough; they were
not jostling one another, but with cheerful carelessness people
dived into it as you dive into a scrimmage at football, and
propelled the unresisting herd towards the entrance, the result
being, of course, that a mass of people got wedged into the
doorway, and the process of getting out took longer than it
need have done; and had there been a panic, nothing could
have prevented people being crushed to death. After this I
went to a friend’s house to break the fast and eat <i>kulich</i>, <i>Paskha</i>,
and Easter eggs, and finally returned home when the dawn
was faintly shining on the dark waters of the Moscow River,
whence the ice had only lately disappeared.</p>

<p>In the morning people came to bring me Easter greetings,
and to give me Easter eggs, and to receive gifts. I was writing
in my sitting-room and I heard a faint mutter in the next room,
a small voice murmuring, <i>Gospodi, Gospodi</i> (“Lord, Lord”).
I went to see who it was, and found it was the policeman, sighing
for his tip, not wishing to disturb, but at the same time anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to indicate his presence. He brought me a crimson egg. Then
came the doorkeeper and the cook. The policeman must,
I think, have been pleased with his tip, because policemen kept
on coming all the morning, and there were not more than two
who belonged to my street.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to a hospital for wounded soldiers
to see them keep Easter, which they did by playing blind man’s
buff to the sound of a flute played by one poor man who was
crippled for life. One of the soldiers gave me as an Easter gift
a poem, a curious human document. It is in two parts called
“Past and Present.” This one is “Present”:</p>

<p>These two poems, seemingly so contradictory, were the
sincere expression of the situation of the man, who was a
cripple in the hospital. He gave both sides of each situation—that
of freedom and that of living in a hospital.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon I went to one of the permanent
fairs or markets in the town, where there were many booths.
Everything was sold here, and here the people bought their
clothes. They were then buying their summer yachting caps.
One man offered me a stolen gold watch for a small sum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Another begged me to buy him a pair of cheap boots. I did
so; upon which he said: “Now that you have made half a
man of me, make a whole man of me by buying me a jacket.”
I refused, however, to make a whole man of him.</p>

<p>On Easter Monday I went out to luncheon with some friends
in the <i>Intelligentsia</i>. We were a large party, and one of
the guests was an officer who had been to the war. Towards
the end of luncheon, when everybody was convivial, healths
were drunk, and one young man, who proclaimed loudly
that he was a Social Revolutionary, drank to the health of
the Republic. I made great friends with the Social Revolutionary
during luncheon. When this health was drunk, I
was alarmed as to what the officer might do. But the officer
turned out to be this man’s brother. The officer himself made
a speech which was, I think, the most brilliant example of
compromise I have ever heard; for he expressed his full
sympathy with the Liberal movement in Russia, including its
representatives in the extreme parties, and at the same time
his unalterable loyalty to his Sovereign.</p>

<p>After luncheon, the Social Revolutionary, who had sworn
me eternal friendship, was told that I had relations in London
who managed a bank. So he came up to me and said: “If
<i>you</i> give our Government one penny in the way of a loan I shall
shoot you dead.”</p>

<p>After that we danced for the rest of the afternoon. The
Social Revolutionary every now and then inveighed against
loans and expressed his hope that the Government would be
bankrupt.</p>

<p>In May I went to St. Petersburg for the opening of the Duma,
and I stayed there till the Duma was dissolved in July.</p>

<p>The brief life of the first Duma was an extraordinarily
interesting spectacle to watch. The Duma met in the beautiful
Taurid palace that Catherine the Second built for Potemkin. In
the lobby, which was a large Louis XV. ballroom, members and
visitors used to flock in crowds, smoke cigarettes, and throw
away the ashes and the ends on to the parquet floor. There
were peasant members in their long black coats, some of them
wearing crosses and medals; Popes, Tartars, Poles, men in
every kind of dress except uniform.</p>

<p>There was an air of intimacy, ease, and familiarity about
the whole proceedings. The speeches were eloquent, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
signs of political experience or statesmanlike action were to be
discerned.</p>

<p>I got to know a great many of the members: Aladin, who
was looked upon as a violent firebrand, and the star of the Left;
Milioukov, the leader of the Kadets, who was well known as a
journalist and a professor; Kovolievsky, also a well-known
writer and professor, a large, genial, comfortable man with an
embracing manner and a great warmth of welcome, and a rich,
flowing vocabulary.</p>

<p>The peasants liked him and he was the only politician
whom they trusted. They sent him a deputation to inform him
that whenever he stood up to vote they intended to stand up
in a body, and whenever he remained seated they would remain
seated too. I also knew many peasant members.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Duma resulted in a deadlock between
it and the Government from the very first moment it met.
It soon became obvious that the Government must either
dissolve the Duma or form a Ministry taken from the Duma,
that is to say, from the opposition. The question was, if they
did not wish to do that, would the country stand a dissolution
or would there be a revolution? The crucial question of the
hour was, should the Government appoint a Kadet Ministry,
consisting of Liberals belonging to the Constitutional Democratic
party who formed the great majority of the Duma, or
should they dissolve the Duma? There was no third course
possible. I thought at the time that events would move more
quickly than they did. I thought if the Duma were dissolved,
not only disorder but immediate, open, and universal revolution
would follow.</p>

<p>The army was shaky. Non-commissioned officers of the
Guards regiments were in touch with the Labour members of
the Duma, and their conversations, at which I sometimes
assisted, were not reassuring. My impression from these conversations
and from all the talks I had with the peasants and
Labour members was that revolution, if and when it did come,
would be a terrible thing, and I thought it might quite likely
come at once. Mutinies had occurred in more than sixty regiments;
a regiment of Guards, the Emperor’s own regiment,
had revolted in St. Petersburg. I thought the dissolution
would be the signal for an immediate outbreak of some kind.
I knew nothing decisive could happen till the army turned. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
thought the army might turn, or turn sufficiently to give the
Liberal leaders the upper hand. I was mistaken.</p>

<p>At the end of July 1906 the Government was vacillating;
they were on the verge of capitulation, and within an ace of
forming a Kadet Ministry. I think they were only prevented
from doing so by the appearance on the scene of P. A. Stolypin.
As soon as Stolypin made his first speech in the Duma, two
things were clear: he was not afraid of opposition; he was
determined not to give in. He was going to fight the Duma;
and if necessary he would not shrink from dissolving it, and risking
the consequences. At the end of July, Stolypin strongly
urged dissolution. He argued that if the Kadets came into
power they would not remain in office a week, but would be at
the mercy of the Extremists, and at once replaced by the
Extreme Left, and swept away by an inrush of unripe and inexperienced
Social Democrats who hated the Liberals more
bitterly than they hated the Government. There would then,
he thought, be no possibility of building a dam or barrier against
the tide of revolution, and the country would be plunged in
anarchy. Judging from what occurred in 1917, Stolypin’s forecast
was correct. For this is precisely what happened then.
The Liberals were at once turned out of office, and replaced
first by Kerensky and then by Lenin. The pendulum swung
as far to the left as it could go, and this is just what Stolypin
anticipated and feared in 1906.</p>

<p>But many people in responsible positions (including General
Trepov) were advocating the formation of a Kadet Ministry;
and had the Kadets had any leaders of character, experience,
and strength of purpose, the counsel would perhaps have been
a sound one.</p>

<p>At the time I thought the only means of avoiding a civil
war would be to create and support a strong Liberal Ministry.
The objection to this was, there was no such thing available.
What happened was that Stolypin’s advice was listened to.
The Duma was dissolved and no revolution followed. The
army did not turn; the moderate Liberals capitulated without
a fight. They took the dissolution lying down; all they did
was to go to Finland and sign a protest, which had no effect
on the situation. It merely gave the Government a pretext for
disenfranchising certain of their leading members.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that the Duma, which was composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of the flower of intellectual Russia, and certainly had a large
section of public opinion behind it, as well as prestige at home
and abroad, should have capitulated so tamely.</p>

<p>The truth was that neither in the ranks of the moderate
Liberals, nor in those of the Extremists, although they were
in some cases men of exceptional talents, was there one man
sufficiently strong to be a leader. The man of strong character
was on the other side. He was Stolypin; and no one on the
side of the Liberals was a match for him. The Liberals were
journalists, men of letters, professors, and able lawyers, but
there was not one man of action in their ranks.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duma was dissolved and no open revolution
came about, I did not think there would be another act in the
revolutionary drama for another ten years. I put this on public
record at the time, and as it turned out, I was only a year out,
as the revolution took place eleven years after the dissolution
of the first Duma.</p>

<p>All through those summer months I saw many interesting
sights, and made many interesting acquaintances.</p>

<p>One Sunday I spent the afternoon at Peterhof, a suburb of
St. Petersburg, where the Emperor used to live. There in the
park, amidst the trees, the plashing waterfalls, and the tall
fountains, “les grands jets d’eau sveltes parmi les marbres,”
the lilac bushes, and the song of many nightingales, the middle
classes were enjoying their Sunday afternoon and the music
of a band. Suddenly, in this beautiful and not inappropriate
setting, the Empress of Russia passed in an open carriage,
without any escort, looking as beautiful as a flower. I could
not help thinking of Marie Antoinette at the Trianon, and I
wondered whether ten thousand swords would leap from
their scabbards on her behalf.</p>

<p>The most interesting of my acquaintances in the Duma
was Nazarenko, the peasant deputy for Karkoff. Professor
Kovolievsky introduced me to him. Nazarenko was far the
most remarkable of the peasant deputies. He was a tall,
striking figure, with black hair, a pale face, with prominent
clearly cut features, such as Velasquez would have taken to
paint a militant apostle. He had been through a course of
primary education, and by subsequently educating himself
he had assimilated a certain amount of culture. Besides this,
he was an eloquent speaker, and a most original character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want to go to London,” he said, “so that the English
may see a real peasant and not a sham one, and so that I can
tell the English what we, the real people, think and feel about
them.” I said I was glad he was going. “I shan’t go unless
I am chosen by the others,” he answered. “I have written
my name down and asked, but I shan’t ask twice. I never ask
twice for anything. When I say my prayers I only ask God
once for a thing; and if it is not granted, I never ask again.
And so it’s not likely I would ask my fellow-men twice for anything.
I am like that; I leave out that passage in the prayers
about being a miserable slave. I am not a miserable slave,
neither of man nor of Heaven.” “That is what the Church
calls spiritual pride,” I answered. “I don’t believe in all that,”
he answered. “My religion is the same as that of Tolstoy.”
He then pointed to the ikon which is in the lobby of the Duma.
“I pay no attention to that,” he said. “It is a board covered
with gilt; but a lot of people think that the ikon is God.”</p>

<p>I asked him if he liked Tolstoy’s books. “Yes,” he answered.
“His books are great, but his philosophy is weak.
It may be all right for mankind thousands of years hence, but
it is of no use now. I have no friends,” he continued. “Books
are my friends. But lately my house was burnt, and all my
books with it. I have read a lot, but I never had anybody to
tell me what to read, so I read without any system. I did not
go to school till I was thirteen.”</p>

<p>“Do you like Dostoievsky’s books?” “Yes; he knows
all about the human soul. When I see a man going downhill,
I know exactly how it will happen, and what he is going through,
and I could stop him because I have read Dostoievsky.” “Have
you read translations of any foreign books?” “Very few;
some of Zola’s books, but I don’t like them, because he does not
really know the life he is describing. Some of Guy de Maupassant’s
stories I have read, but I do not like them either
because I don’t want to know more about that kind of people
than I know already.” “Have you read Shakespeare?”
“Yes. There is nobody like him. When you read a conversation
of Shakespeare’s, when one person is speaking you think
he is right, and when the next person answers him you think
he is right. He understands everybody. But I want to read
Spencer—Herbert Spencer. I have never been able to get his
works.” I promised to procure him Herbert Spencer’s works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening I went to see Nazarenko in his house. He was
not at home, but a friend of his was there. He told me to wait.
He was a peasant; thirty-nine years old, rather bald, with a nice
intelligent face. At first he took no notice of me, and read
aloud to himself out of a book. Then he suddenly turned to me
and asked me who I was. I said I was an English correspondent.
He got up, shut the door, and begged me to stay. “Do the
English know the condition of the Russian peasantry?” he
asked. “They think we are wolves and bears. Do I look like
a wolf? Please say I am not a wolf.” Then he ordered some
tea, and got a bottle of beer. He asked me to tell him how
labourers lived in England, what their houses were made
of, what wages a labourer received, what was the price of
meat, whether they ate meat? Then he suddenly, to my
intense astonishment, put the following question to me: “In
England do they think that Jesus Christ was a God or only
a great man?” I asked him what he thought. He said he
thought He was a great man. He said that the Russian
people were religious and superstitious; they were deceived by
the priests, who threatened them with damnation. He asked
me if I could lend him an English Bible. He wanted to see
if it was the same as a Russian Bible. I said it was exactly
the same. He was immensely astonished. “Do you mean to
say,” he asked, “that there are all those stories about Jonah
and the whale, and Joshua and the moon?” I said “Yes.”
“I thought,” he said, “those had been put in for us.” I tried
to explain to him that Englishmen were taught almost exactly
the same thing, and that the Anglican and the Orthodox Church
used the same Bible. We then talked of ghosts. He asked
me if I believed in ghosts. I said I did. He asked why. I
gave various reasons. He said he could believe in a kind of
telepathy, a kind of moral wireless telegraphy; but ghosts were
the invention of old women. He suddenly asked me whether
the earth was four thousand years old. “Of course it’s older,”
he said. “But that’s what we are taught. We are taught
nothing about geography and geology. It is, of course, a fact
that there is no such thing as God,” he said; “because, if there
is a God, He must be a just God; and as there is so much injustice
in the world, it is plain that a just God does not exist.
But you,” he went on, “an Englishman who has never been
deceived by officials, do you believe that God exists?” (He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
thought that all ideas of religion and God as taught to the
Russian people were part of a great official lie.) “I do,” I
said. “Why?” he asked. I asked him if he had read the
Book of Job. He said he had. I said that when Job has
everything taken away from him, although he has done no
wrong, suddenly, in the last depth of his misery, he recognises
the existence of God in the immensity of nature, and feels that
his own soul is a part of a plan too vast for him to conceive
or to comprehend. In feeling that he is part of the scheme, he
acknowledges the existence of God, and that is enough; he
is able to consent, and to console himself, although in dust
and ashes. That was, I said, what I thought one could feel.
He admitted the point of view, but he did not share it. After
we had had tea we went for a walk in some gardens not far off,
where there were various theatrical performances going on.
The audience amused me, it applauded so rapturously and insisted
on an encore, whatever was played, and however it was
played, with such thunderous insistence. “Priests,” said my
friend, “base everything on the devil. There is no devil.
There was no fall of man. There are no ghosts, no spirits, but
there are millions and millions of other inhabited worlds.”</p>

<p>I left him late, when the performance was over. This
man, who was a member of the Duma for the government of
Tula, was called Petrukin. I looked up his name in the list
of members, and found he had been educated in the local church
school of the village of Kologrivo; that he had spent the whole
of his life in this village, and had been engaged in agriculture;
that among the peasants he enjoyed great popularity as being
a clever and hard-working man. He belonged to no party.
He was not in the least like the men of peasant origin who had
assimilated European culture. He was naturally sensible and
alert of mind.</p>

<p>One Sunday I went by train to a place called Terrioki, in
Finland, where a meeting was to be held by the Labour Party
of the Duma. The train was crowded with people who looked
more like holiday-makers than political supporters of the
Extreme Left—so crowded that one had to stand up on the
platform outside the carriage throughout the journey. After
a journey of an hour and a quarter we arrived at Terrioki.
The crowd leapt from the train and immediately unfurled red
flags and sang the “Marseillaise.” The crowd occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
second line, and a policeman observed that, as another train
was coming in and would occupy that line, it would be advisable
if they were to move on. “What?—police even here in free
Finland?” somebody cried. “The police are elected here by
the people,” was the pacifying reply; and the crowd moved
on, formed into a procession six abreast, and started marching
to the gardens where the meeting was to be held, singing the
“Marseillaise” and other songs all the way. The dust was so
thick that, after marching with the procession for some time,
I took a cab and told the driver to take me to the meeting.
We drove off at a brisk speed past innumerable wooden houses,
villas, shops (where Finnish knives and English tobacco were
sold), into a wood. After we had driven for twenty minutes I
asked the driver if we still had far to go. He turned round and,
smiling, said in pidgin-Russian (he was a Finn): “Me not know
where you want to go.” Then we turned back, and, after a
long search and much questioning of passers-by, found the
garden, into which one was admitted by ticket. (Here, again,
anyone could get in.) In a large grassy and green garden,
shady with many trees, a kind of wooden semicircular proscenium
had been erected, and in one part of it was a low platform not
more spacious than a table. On the proscenium the red
flags were hung. In front of the table there were a few
benches, but the greater part of the public stood. The
inhabitants of the villas were here in large numbers; there
were not many workmen, but a number of students and
various other members of the <i>Intelligentsia</i>—young men with
undisciplined hair and young ladies in large <i>art nouveau</i> hats
and <i>Reformkleider</i>. M. Zhilkin, the leader of the Labour Party
in the Duma, took the chair.</p>

<p>The meeting was opened by a man who laid stress on the
necessity of a Constituent Assembly. Speeches succeeded one
another. Students climbed up into the pine trees and on
the roof of the proscenium. Others lay on the grass behind
the crowd. “Land and Liberty” was the burden of the
speeches. There was nothing new or striking said. The
hackneyed commonplaces were rolled out one after another.
Indignation, threats, menaces, blood and thunder. And all
the time the sun shone hotter and “all Nature looked smiling
and gay.” The audience applauded, but no fierceness of
invective, no torrent of rhetoric, managed to make the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
a serious one. Nature is stronger than speeches, and sunshine
more potent than rant. It is true the audience were enjoying
themselves; but they were enjoying the outing, and the speeches
were an agreeable incidental accompaniment. They enjoyed
the attacks on the powers that be, as the Bank-holiday maker
enjoys Aunt Sally at the seaside. Some Finns spoke in Russian
and Finnish, and then Aladin made a speech. As he rose he
met with an ovation. Aladin was of peasant extraction. He
had been to the University in Russia, emigrated to London,
had been a dock labourer, a printer’s devil, a journalist,
an electrical engineer, a teacher of Russian; he spoke French
and German perfectly, and English so well that he spoke Russian
with a London accent. Aladin had a great contempt for the
methods of the Russian revolutionaries. He said that only people
without any stuff in them would demand a Constituent Assembly.
“You don’t demand a Constituent Assembly; you constitute
it,” he said. “The Russian people would never be free until
they showed by their acts that they meant to be free.” Aladin
spoke without any gesticulation. He was a dark, shortish man,
with a small moustache and grey, serious eyes, short hair, and
had a great command of mordant language. His oratory on
this occasion was particularly nervous and pithy. But he
did not succeed in turning that audience of holiday-makers
into a revolutionary meeting. The inhabitants of the villas
clapped. The young ladies in large hats chortled with delight.
It was a glorious picnic—an ecstatic game of Aunt Sally. And
when the interval came, the public rushed to the restaurants.
There was one on the seashore, with a military band playing.
There was a beach and a pier, and boats and bathers. Here
was the true inwardness of the meeting. Many people remained
on the beach for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duma was dissolved I went to Moscow and
stayed a few days at Marie Karlovna’s <i>datcha</i> at Tsaritsina,
near Moscow.</p>

<p>Near the house where I was living there was a village; as
this village was close to the town of Moscow, I thought that its
inhabitants would be suburban. This was not so. The nearness
to Moscow seemed to make no difference at all. I was
walking through the village one morning, when a peasant who
was sitting on his doorstep called me and asked me if I would
like to eat an apple. I accepted his invitation. He said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
presumed I was living with Marie Karlovna, as other Englishmen
had lived there before. Then he asked abruptly: “Is
Marie Alexandrovna in your place?” I said my hostess’s
name was Marie Karlovna. “Of course,” he said, “I don’t
mean here, but in your place, in your country.” I didn’t
understand. Then he said it again louder, and asked if I
was deaf. I said I wasn’t deaf, and that I understood what
he said, but I did not know whom he was alluding to. “Talking
to you,” he said, “is like talking to a Tartar. You look at
one and don’t understand what one says.” Then it suddenly
flashed on me that he was alluding to the Duchess of Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
“You mean the relation of our Queen Alexandra?” I said.
“That’s what I mean,” he answered. “Your Queen is the
sister of the Empress Marie Feodorovna.” It afterwards
appeared that he thought that England had been semi-Russianised
owing to this relationship.</p>

<p>Two more peasants joined us, and one of them brought a
small bottle (the size of a sample) of vodka and a plate of
cherries. “We will go and drink this in the orchard,” they
said. So we went to the orchard. “You have come here to
learn,” said the first peasant, a bearded man, whose name was
Feodor. “Many Englishmen have been here to learn. I
taught one all the words that we use.” I said I was a correspondent;
that I had just arrived from St. Petersburg, where
I had attended the sittings of the Duma. “What about the
Duma?” asked the other peasant. “They’ve sent it away.
Will there be another one?” I said a manifesto spoke of a
new one. “Yes,”said Feodor, “there is a manifesto abolishing
punishments.” I said I hadn’t observed that clause.
“Will they give us back our land?” asked Feodor. “All
the land here belongs to us really.” Then followed a long
explanation as to why the land belonged to them. It was
Crown property. I said I did not know. “If they don’t
give it back to us we shall take it,” he said simply. Then
one of the other peasants added: “Those manifestos are not
written by the Emperor, but by the ‘authorities.’” (The
same thing was said to me by a cabman at St. Petersburg,
his reason being that the Emperor would say “I,” whereas
the manifesto said “We.”) Then they asked me why they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
had not won the war, and whether it was true that the war
had been badly managed. “We know nothing,” he said.
“What newspaper tells the truth? Where can we find the
real truth? Is it to be found in the <i>Russkoe Slovo</i>?” (a big
Moscow newspaper). They asked me about the Baltic Fleet
and why Admiral Nebogatov had made a signal which meant
“Beat us.”</p>

<p>I went away, and as I was going Feodor asked me if I
would like to go and see the haymaking the next day. If so,
I had better be at his house at three o’clock in the afternoon.
The next day, Sunday, I kept my appointment, but found
nobody at home in the house of Feodor except a small child.
“Is Feodor at home?” I asked. A man appeared from a
neighbouring cottage and said: “Feodor is in the inn, drunk.”
“Is he going to the haymaking?” I asked. “Of course,
he’s going.” “Is he very drunk?” I asked. “No, not
very; I will tell him you are here.” And the man went to
fetch him. Then a third person arrived—a young peasant
in his Sunday clothes—and asked me where I was going. I
said I was going to make hay. “Do you know how to?”
he asked. I said I didn’t. “I see,” he said, “you are just
going to amuse yourself. I advise you not to go. They will
be drunk, and there might be unpleasantness.”</p>

<p>Presently Feodor arrived, apparently perfectly sober except
that he was rather red in the face. He harnessed his horse
to a cart. “Would I mind not wearing my hat, but one of
his?” he asked. I said I didn’t mind, and he lent me a dark
blue yachting cap, which is what the peasants wear all over
Russia. My shirt was all right. I had got on a loose Russian
shirt without a collar. He explained that it would look odd
to be seen with someone wearing such a hat as I had. It
was a felt hat. The little boy who was running about the
house was Feodor’s son. He was barefooted, and one of his
feet was bound up. I asked what was the matter with it.
The bandage was at once taken off, and I was shown the
remains of a large blister and gathering. “It’s been cured
now,” Feodor said. “It was a huge blister. It was cured
by witchcraft. I took him to the Wise Woman, and she put
something on it and said a few words, and the pain stopped,
and it got quite well. Doctors are no good; they only cut
one about. I was kicked by a horse and the pain was terrible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
I drank a lot of vodka, and it did no good; then I went to the
Wise Woman and she put ointment on the place and she
spoke away the pain. We think it’s best to be cured like this—village
fashion.” I knew this practice existed, but it was
curious to find it so near Moscow. It was like finding witchcraft
at Surbiton.</p>

<p>We started for the hay meadows, which were about ten
miles distant. On the road we met other peasants in carts
bound for the same destination. They all gravely took off
their hats to each other. After an hour and a half’s drive
we arrived at the Moscow River, on the bank of which there
is a tea-shop. Tea-shops exist all over Russia. The feature
of them is, that you cannot buy spirits there. We stopped
and had tea. Everybody was brought a small teapot for
tea and a huge teapot of boiling water, and some small cups,
and everybody drank about four or five cups out of the saucer.
They eat the sugar separately, and do not put it into the cup.</p>

<p>We crossed the river on a floating bridge, and, driving past
a large white Byzantine monastery, arrived at the green hay
meadows on the farther river-bank towards sunset. The haymaking
began. The first step which was taken was for vodka
bottles to be produced and for everybody to drink vodka
out of a cup. There was a great deal of shouting and an
immense amount of abuse. “It doesn’t mean anything,”
Feodor said. “We curse each other and make it up afterwards.”
They then drew lots for the particular strip they
should mow, each man carrying his scythe high over his
shoulder. (“Don’t come too near,” said Feodor; “when
men have ‘drink taken’ they are careless with scythes.”)</p>

<p>When the lots were drawn they began mowing. It was a
beautiful sight to see the mowing in the sunset by the river;
the meadows were of an intense soft green; the sky fleecy
and golden to the west, and black with a great thundercloud
over the woods to the east, lit up with intermittent summer
lightning. The mowers were dressed in different coloured shirts—scarlet,
blue, white, and green. They mowed till the twilight
fell and the thundercloud drew near to us. Then Feodor
came and made our cart into a tent by tying up the shafts,
putting a piece of matting across them, and covering it with
hay, and under this he made beds of hay. We had supper,
Feodor said his prayers, and prepared to go to sleep, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
changed his mind, got up, and joined some friends in a neighbouring
cart.</p>

<p>Three children and a deaf-and-dumb peasant remained
with me. The peasants who were in the neighbouring tent
were drunk. They began by quarrelling; then they sang for
about four hours without stopping; then they talked. Feodor
came back about half an hour before it was light, and slept
for that brief space. I did not sleep at all. I wasn’t tired,
and the singing was delightful to hear: so extremely characteristic
of Russia and so utterly unlike the music of any other
country, except Mongolia. The children chattered for some
time about mushroom gathering, and the deaf-and-dumb man
told me a lot by signs, and then everybody went to sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light the mowers all got up and began
mowing. I do not know which was the more beautiful effect—that
of the dusk or of the dawn. The dawn was grey with
pearly clouds and suffused with the faintest pink tinge, and
in the east the sun rose like a red ball, with no clouds near it.
At ten o’clock we drove to an inn and had tea; we then drove
back, and the hay, although it was quite wet, for it had
rained in the night, was carried there and then. “The women
dry it at home,” Feodor explained; “it’s too far for us to
come here twice.” The carts were laden with hay, and I drove
one of them home, lying on the top of the hay, in my sleep.
I had always envied the drivers of carts whom one meets
lying on a high load of hay, fast asleep, and now I know from
experience that there is no such delicious slumber, with the
kind sun warming one through and through after a cold night,
and the slow jolting of the wagon rocking one, and the smell
of the hay acting like a soporific. Every now and then I
awoke to see the world through a golden haze, and then one
fell back and drowsed with pleasure in a deep slumber of an
inexpressibly delicious quality.</p>

<p>When we recrossed the river we again stopped for tea. As
we were standing outside an old woman passed us, and just
as she passed, one of the peasants said to me: “Sit down, <i>Barin</i>.”
<i>Barin</i> means a <i>monsieur</i>, in contradistinction to the lower class.
“Very like a <i>Barin</i>,” said the woman, with a sarcastic snort,
upon which the peasant told her in the plainest and most uncomplimentary
speech I have ever heard exactly what he thought
of her personal appearance, her antecedents, and what she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
fit for. She passed on with dignity and in silence. After
a time, I climbed up on the wagon again, and sank back into
my green paradise of dreams, and remembered nothing more
till we arrived home at five o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>A few days later I travelled from Moscow to St. Petersburg
by a slow train in a third-class carriage. In the carriage there
was a mixed and representative assembly of people: a priest,
a merchant from Kursk, a photographer from Tchelabinsk, a
young volunteer—that is to say, a young man doing his year’s
military service previous to becoming an officer—two minor
public servants, an ex-soldier who had been through the Turkish
campaign, a soldier who had lately returned from Manchuria,
three peasants, two Tartars, a tradesman, a carpenter, and
some others. Besides these, a band of gipsies (with their
children) encamped themselves on the platform outside the
carriage, and penetrated every now and then into the carriage
until they were driven out by threats and curses.</p>

<p>The first thing everybody did was to make themselves
thoroughly comfortable—to arrange mattresses and pillows
for the night; then they began to make each other’s acquaintance.
We had not travelled far before the gipsies began to
sing on the platform, and this created some interest. They
suggested fortune-telling, but the ex-soldier shouted at them
in a gruff voice to begone. One of the officials had his fortune
told. The gipsy said she could do it much better for five roubles
(ten shillings) than for a few kopecks which he had given. I
had my fortune told, which consisted in a hurried rigmarole
to the effect that I was often blamed, but never blamed others;
that I could only work if I was my own master, and that I
would shortly experience a great change of fortune. The
gipsy added that if I could give her five roubles she would tie
a piece of bark in my handkerchief which, with the addition of
a little bread and salt, would render me immune from danger.
The gipsies soon got out. The journey went on uneventfully.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Le moine disait son bréviaire,</div>
<div class="verse">… Une femme chantait,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as in La Fontaine’s fable. We had supper and tea, and the
ex-soldier related the experiences of his life, saying he had
travelled much and seen the world (he was a Cossack by birth)
and was not merely a <i>Muzhik</i>. This offended one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
peasants, a bearded man, who walked up from his place and
grunted in protest, and then walked back again.</p>

<p>They began to talk politics. The Cossack was asked his
opinion on the attitude of the Cossacks. He said their attitude
had changed, and that they objected to police service. The
photographer from Tchelabinsk corroborated this statement,
saying he had been present at a Cossack meeting in Siberia.
Then we had a short concert. The photographer produced a
mandoline and played tunes. All the inmates of the carriage
gathered round him. One of the peasants said: “Although
I am an ignorant man” (it was the peasant who had grunted)
“I could see at once that he wasn’t simply playing with his
fingers, but with something else” (the tortoiseshell that twangs
the mandoline). He asked the photographer how much a
mandoline cost. On being told thirty roubles he said he would
give thirty roubles to be able to play as well as that. Somebody,
by way of appreciation, put a cigarette into the mouth of the
photographer as he was playing.</p>

<p>I went to bed in the next compartment, but not to sleep,
because a carpenter, who had the bed opposite mine, told
me the whole melancholy story of his life. The volunteer
appeared later; he had been educated in the Cadet Corps,
and I asked him if he would soon be an officer, “I will never
be an officer,” he answered; “I don’t want to be one <i>now</i>.” I
asked him if a statement I had read in the newspapers was true,
to the effect that several officers had telegraphed to the Government
that unless they were relieved of police duty they would
resign. He said it was quite true; that discontent prevailed
among officers; that the life was becoming unbearable;
that they were looked down upon by the rest of the people;
and besides this, they were ordered about from one place to
another. He liked the officers whom he was with, but they
were sick of the whole thing. Then, towards one in the
morning, I got a little sleep. As soon as it was daylight,
everybody was up making tea and busily discussing politics.
The priest and the tradesman were having a discussion about
the Duma, and everyone else, including the guard, was
joining in.</p>

<p>“Do you understand what the Duma was?” said the
tradesman; “the Duma was simply the people. Do you know
what all that talk of a movement of liberation means? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
means simply this: that we want control, responsibility.
That if you are to get or to pay five roubles or fifty roubles,
you will get or pay five roubles or fifty roubles, not more and
not less, and that nobody will have the right to interfere; and
that if someone interferes he will be responsible. The first thing
the Duma asked for was a responsible Ministry, and the reason
why it was dissolved is that the Government would not give
that.”</p>

<p>The priest said that he approved of a Duma, but unless
men changed themselves, no change of government was of any
use. “Man must change inwardly,” he said.</p>

<p>“I believe in God,” answered the tradesman, “but it is
written in the Scripture that God said: ‘Take the earth and
cultivate it,’ and that is what we have got to do—to make the
best of this earth. When we die we shall go to Heaven, and
then”—he spoke in a practical tone of voice which settled the
matter—“then we shall have to do with God.” The priest took
out his Bible and found a passage in the Gospel. “This revolutionary
movement will go on,” he said, “nothing can stop
it now; but mark my words, we shall see oceans of blood shed
first, and this prophecy will come true,” and he read the text
about one stone not being left on another.</p>

<p>They then discussed the priesthood and the part played by
priests. “The priests play an abominable part,” said the
tradesman; “they are worse than murderers. A murderer
is a man who goes and kills someone. He is not so bad as the
man who stays at home and tells others to kill. That is what
the priests do.” He mentioned a monk who had preached
against the Jews in the south of Russia. “I call that man the
greatest criminal, because he stirred up the peasants’ blood,
and they went to kill the Jews. Lots of peasants cease to go to
church and say their prayers at home because of this. When
the Cossacks come to beat them, the priests tell them that they
are sent by God. Do you believe they are sent by God?”
he asked, turning to the bearded peasant.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the peasant; “I think they are sent by
the devil.” The priest said that the universal dominion of the
Jews was at hand. The tradesman contested this, and said
that in Russia the Jews were assimilated more quickly than
in other countries. “The Jews are cunning,” said the priest;
“the Russians are in a ditch, and they go to the Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
say: ‘Pull us out.’” “If that is true,” said the tradesman,
“we ought to put up a gold statue to the Jews for pulling
us out of the ditch. Look at the time of the <i>pogroms</i>; the
rich Russians ran away, but the richest Jews stayed behind.”
“They are clever; they knew their business. If they stayed
you may be sure they gained something by it,” said the merchant
from Kursk. “But we ought to be clever, too,” said the
tradesman, “and try and imitate their self-sacrifice. Look at
the Duma. There were twenty Jews in the Duma, but they
did not bring forward the question of equal rights for the Jews
before anything else, as they might have done. It is criminal
for the priests to attack the Jews, and if they go on like this,
the people will leave them.”</p>

<p>“Whereas,” said the merchant from Kursk thoughtfully,
“if they helped the people, the people would never desert
them.” “The priests,” said one of the other nondescript
people, “say that Catherine the Second is a goddess; and for
that reason her descendants have a hundred thousand acres.
General Trepov will be canonised when he dies, and his bones
will work miracles.”</p>

<p>The guard joined in here, and told his grievances at great
length.</p>

<p>At one of the stations there was a fresh influx of people;
among others, an old peasant and a young man in a blouse.
The old peasant complained of the times. “Formerly we all had
enough to eat; now there is not enough,” he said. “People
are clever now. When I was a lad, if I did not obey my grandfather
immediately, he used to box my ears; now my son is
surprised because I don’t obey him. People have all become
clever, and the result is we have got nothing to eat.” The
young man said the Government was to blame for most things.
“That’s a difficult question to be clear about. How can we be
clear about it? We know nothing,” said the old peasant.
“You ought to try and know, or else things will never get
better,” said the young man. “I don’t want to listen to a
<i>Barin</i> like you,” said the old peasant. “I’m not a <i>Barin</i>, I am
a peasant, even as thou art,” said the young man. “Nonsense,”
said the old peasant. “Thou liest.”</p>

<p>The discussion was then cut short by our arrival at St.
Petersburg.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ST. PETERSBURG</span></h2>

<p>In October 1906 I took up my duties as correspondent
to the <i>Morning Post</i> at St. Petersburg. I took an
apartment on the ground floor of a little street running
out of the Bolshaya Konioushnaya.</p>

<p>The situation which was created by the dissolution of the
Duma was aptly summed up by a Japanese, who said that in
Russia an incompetent Government was being opposed by an
ineffectual revolution. Although no active revolution followed
the dissolution of the Duma, a sporadic civil war spread all over
the country, accompanied by anarchy, and an epidemic of
political and social crime. Governors of provinces were blown
up; Stolypin’s house was blown up, his daughter injured, and he
himself only narrowly escaped; banks were robbed; policemen
were shot; and the political crimes of the Intellectuals were
imitated on a wider scale by the discontented proletariat and
the criminal class.</p>

<p>The professional criminals reasoned thus: “If University
students can rob a bank in a deserving public cause, why
should not we tramps rob and kill a banker in a deserving
private cause?” “Expropriation” became a fashionable sport
among the criminals, and the prevalence of anarchy, licence, and
robbery under arms had the effect of disgusting the man in the
street with all things revolutionary; for all the disorder was
rightly or wrongly put down to the revolutionaries. Had
it not been for this reaction, this turn of the tide in public
opinion, Stolypin would have found it impossible to
carry out his drastic measures. On the other hand, the
Government met the situation with martial law and drumhead
court-martials; revolutionary and other crimes were
answered by reprisals and summary executions; and daily
the record of crime and punishment increased, and Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
seemed to be caught in a vicious circle of repression and
anarchy.</p>

<p>The watchword of Stolypin’s policy was Order first, Reform
afterwards.</p>

<p>He defended the nature of the steps taken to restore order
by saying that when a house is on fire, in order to save what can
be saved, you are obliged to hack down what cannot be saved,
ruthlessly. He certainly did restore order, and he also initiated
certain large measures which made for reform—his Land Bill
and his Education Bill; but all the reforms that were started
during his administration were curtailed by his successors; and
the idea which ran through the policy of all Russian Governments
like a baleful thread from 1906 to 1907, was to take back with
one hand what had been given with the other.</p>

<p>Consequently the fire of discontent, instead of being extinguished,
was maintained in a smouldering condition.</p>

<p>The Manifesto of 30th October 1904 promised, firstly, the
creation of a deliberative and legislative Assembly, without
whose consent no new laws should be passed; and secondly,
the full rights of citizenship—the inviolability of the person,
freedom of conscience, freedom of the Press, the right of
organising public meetings, and founding associations.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, in the years which followed the granting
of this Charter until the revolution of 1917, these promises
were either not carried out at all, or were only allowed to
operate in virtue of temporary regulations which were (<i>a</i>) liable
to constant amendment; (<i>b</i>) could be interpreted by local
officials.</p>

<p>Stolypin’s policy of “Order first, Reform afterwards,” had
two results: firstly, as soon as order was restored by Stolypin,
all ideas of reform were shelved by his successors. Stolypin
himself was assassinated. Secondly, in the eyes of the Administration
criticism became the greatest crime, because
criticism was held to be subversive to the prestige of the
Government. The officials, and especially the secret police,
throve and battened on this situation. Accordingly, as order
was restored material prosperity increased; but this was a
palliative and not a remedy to the fundamental discontent.
It only led to moral stagnation.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1906, while this cycle of anarchy on the
one hand and repression on the other was setting in, elections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
were held for another Duma. I had a long talk one day with
Stolypin himself. He struck me as a man of character, absolute
integrity, <i>rigidæ innocentiæ</i>, and great personal courage.
But he had come too late on the scene of Russian politics. He
would have been an admirable minister in the reign of Alexander
the Second, or Alexander the Third. As it was, he was engaged
not in diverting a torrent into a useful and profitable channel,
but in damming it. He succeeded in damming it temporarily;
but the dam was bound to be swept away, and he paid for the
work with his own life.</p>

<p>During the winter I saw a great many Russians; members
of the Duma used to come and dine with me, and I was in close
touch with the political life. But the most interesting
experience I had that winter was a journey I made to the
north. I will describe it in detail.</p>

<p>I meant to go to Archangel, and I started for Vologda
at night. The battle for a place in the third-class carriage
was fought and won for me by a porter. When I stepped
into the third-class carriage it was like entering pandemonium.
It was almost dark, save for a feeble candle that
guttered peevishly over the door, and all the inmates were
yelling and throwing their boxes and baskets and bundles
about. This was only the process of installation; it all
quieted down presently, and everyone seated himself with
his bed unfolded, if he had one, his luggage stowed away, his
provisions spread out, as if he had been living there for years,
and meant to remain there for many years to come.</p>

<p>This particular carriage was full. The people in it were
workmen going home for the winter, peasants, merchants, and
mechanics. Opposite to my seat were two workmen (painters),
and next to them a peasant with a big grey beard. Sitting by
the farther window was a well-dressed mechanic. The painter
lighted a candle and stuck it on a small movable table that
projected from my window; he produced a small bottle of
vodka from his pocket, a kettle for tea, and some cold sausage,
and general conversation began. The guard came to tell the
people who had come to see their friends off—there were numbers
of them in the carriage, and they were most of them drunk—to
go. The guard looked at my ticket for Vologda and asked
me where I was ultimately going to. I said: “Viatka,” upon
which the mechanic said: “So am I; we will go together and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
get our tickets together at Vologda.” The painter and the
mechanic engaged in conversation, and it appeared that they
both came from Kronstadt. The painter had worked there
for twenty years, and he cross-questioned the mechanic with
evident pleasure, winking at me every now and then. The
mechanic went into the next compartment for a moment, and
the painter then said to me with glee: “He is lying; he says
he has worked in Kronstadt, and he doesn’t know where such
and such things are.” The mechanic came back. “Who is
the Commandant at Kronstadt?” asked the painter. The
mechanic evidently did not know, and gave a name at random.
The painter laughed triumphantly and said that the Commandant
was someone else. Then the mechanic volunteered further
information to show his knowledge of Kronstadt; he talked
of another man who worked there—a tall man; the painter said
that the man was short. The mechanic said that he was employed
in the manufacture of shells. They talked of disorders
at Kronstadt that had happened a year before. The painter
said that he and his son lay among cabbages while the fighting
was going on. He added that the matter had nearly ended
in the total destruction of Kronstadt. “God forbid!” said the
peasant sitting next to me. No sympathy was expressed with
the mutineers. The painter at last told the mechanic that he
had lived for twenty years at Kronstadt, and that he, the
mechanic, was a liar. The mechanic protested feebly. He was
an obvious liar, but why he told these lies I have no idea. Perhaps
he was not a mechanic at all. Possibly he was a spy.
He professed to be a native of a village near Viatka, and declared
that he had been absent for six years (the next evening he said
twelve years).</p>

<p>From this question of disorders at Kronstadt the talk
veered, I forget how, to the topic of the Duma. “Which
Duma?” someone asked; “the town Duma?” “No, the
State Duma,” said the mechanic; “it seems they are going to
have a new one.” “Nothing will come of it,” said the painter;
“people will not go.” (He meant the voters.) “No, they
won’t go,” said the peasant, cutting the air with his hand (a
gesture common to nearly all Russians of that class), “because
they know now that it means being put in prison.” “Yes,”
said the painter, “they are hanging everybody.” And there
was a knowing chorus of: “They won’t go and vote; they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
better.” Then the mechanic left his seat and sat down next
to the painter and said in a whisper: “The Government⸺”
At that moment the guard came in; the mechanic stopped
abruptly, and when the guard went out, the topic of conversation
had been already changed. I heard no further mention of the
Duma during the whole of the rest of the journey to Vologda.
The people then began to prepare to go to sleep, except the
peasant, who told me that he often went three days together
without sleep, but when he did sleep it was a business to wake
him. He asked me if his bundle of clothes was in my way.
“We are a rough people,” he said, “but we know how not to
get in the way. I am not going far.” I was just going to
sleep when I was wakened by a terrific noise in the next compartment.
Someone opened the door, and the following scraps
of shouted dialogue were audible. A voice: “Did you say I
was drunk or did you not?” Second voice (obviously the
guard): “I asked for your ticket.” First voice: “You said
I was drunk. You are a liar.” Second voice: “You have
no right to say I am a liar. I asked for your ticket.” First
voice: “You are a liar. You said I was drunk. I will have
you discharged.” This voice then recited a long story to the
public in general. The next day I learnt that the offended
man was a lawyer, one of the bourgeoisie (a workman explained
to me), and that the guard had, in the dark, asked him for his
ticket, and then, as he made no sign of life, had pinched his foot;
this having proved ineffectual, he said that the man was drunk;
whereupon the man started to his feet and became wide awake
in a moment. Eventually a gendarme was brought in, a “protocol”
was drawn up, in which both sides of the story were
written down, and there, I expect, the matter will remain until
the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>I afterwards made the acquaintance of two men in the next
compartment; they were dock labourers, and their business
was to load ships in Kronstadt. They were exactly like the
people whom Gorki describes. One of them gave me a
description of his mode of life in summer and winter. In
summer he loaded ships; in winter he went to a place near
Archangel and loaded carts with wood; when the spring came,
he went back, by water, to St. Petersburg. He asked me what
I was. I said that I was an English correspondent. He asked
then what I travelled in. I said I was not that kind of correspondent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
but a newspaper correspondent. Here he called a
third friend, who was sitting near us, and said; “Come and
look; there is a correspondent here. He is an English correspondent.”
The friend came—a man with a red beard and a
loose shirt with a pattern of flowers on it. “I don’t know you,”
said the new man. “No; but let us make each other’s acquaintance,”
I said. “You can talk to him,” explained the
dock labourer; “we have been talking for hours; although
he is plainly a man who has received higher education.” “As
to whether he has received higher or lower education we don’t
know,” said the friend, “because we haven’t yet asked him.”
Then he paused, reflected, shook hands, and exclaimed: “Now
we know each other.” “But,” said the dock labourer, “how
do you print your articles? Do you take a printing press with
you when you go, for instance, to the north, like you are doing
now?” I said they were printed in London, and that I did not
have to print them myself. “Please send me one,” he said;
“I will give you my address.” “But it’s written in English,”
I answered. “You can send me a translation in Russian,” he
retorted.</p>

<p>“English ships come to Kronstadt, and we load them. The
men on board do not speak Russian, but we understand each
other. For instance, we load, and their inspector comes. We
call him ‘inspector’ (I forget the Russian word he used, but it
was something like <i>skipador</i>); they call him the ‘Come on.’
The ‘Come on’ comes, and he says, ‘That’s no good’ (<i>‘Niet
dobrò</i>’<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>); he means not right (<i>nié horosho</i>), and then we make
it right. And when their sailors come, we ask them for matches.
When we have food, what we call <i>coshevar</i>, they call it ‘all
right.’ And when we finish work, what we call <i>shabash</i>
(it means ‘all over’), they call ‘seven o’clock.’ They bring
us matches that light on anything,” and here he produced a
box of English matches and lit a dozen of them just to show.
“When we are raggèd, they say, ‘No clothes, plenty vodka,’
and when we are well dressed, they say, ‘No plenty-vodka,
plenty-clothes.’ Their vodka,” he added, “is very good.”
Then followed an elaborate comparison of the wages and conditions
of life of Russian and English workmen. Another man
joined in, and being told about the correspondent, said: “I
would like to read your writings, because we are a rough people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and we read only the <i>Pieterbourski Listok</i>, which is, so to speak,
a ‘black-gang’ (reactionary) newspaper. Heaven knows what
is happening in Russia! They are hanging, shooting, and
bayoneting everyone.” Then he went away. The dock
labourer went on for hours talking about the “Come on,” the
“All right,” and the “Seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>I went back to my berth and slept, till the dock labourer
came and fetched me, and said that I had to see the soldiers.
I went into the next compartment, and there were two soldiers;
one was dressed up, that is to say he had put on spectacles and
a pocket-handkerchief over his head, and was giving an exhibition
of mimicry, of recruits crying as they left home, of mothers-in-law,
and other stock jokes. It was funny, and it ended in
general singing. A sailor came to look on. He was a non-commissioned
officer, and he told me in great detail how a
meeting at Sveaborg had been put down. He said that the
loyal sailors had been given 150 roubles (£15) apiece to fight.
I think he must have been exaggerating. At the same time he
expressed no sympathy with the mutineers. He said that
rights were all very well for countries such as Finland. But
in Russia they only meant disorder, and as long as the disorder
lasted, Russia would be a feeble country. He had much wanted
to go to the war, but he had not been able to. In fact, he was
thoroughly loyal and <i>bien pensant</i>.</p>

<p>We arrived at Vologda Station some time in the evening.
The station was crowded with peasants. While I was watching
the crowd, a drunken peasant entered and asked everybody to
give him ten kopecks. Then he caught sight of me, and said
that he was quite certain I would give him ten kopecks. I did,
and he danced a kind of wild dance and finally collapsed on
the floor. A man was watching these proceedings, a fairly
respectably dressed man in a pea-jacket. He began to talk to
me, and said that he had just come back from Manchuria,
where he had been employed at Mukden Station. “In spite of
which,” he added, “I have not yet received a medal.” I said
that I had been in Manchuria. He said he lived twenty versts
up the line, and came to the station to look at the people—it
was so amusing. “Have you any acquaintances here?” he
asked. I said, “No.” “Then let us go and have tea.” I was
willing, and we went to the tea-shop, which was exactly opposite
the station. “Here,” said the man, “we will talk of what was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of what is, and of what is to be.” As we were walking in, a
policeman who was standing by the door whispered in my ear:
“I shouldn’t go in there with that <i>gentleman</i>.” “Why?”
I asked. “Well, he’s not quite reliable,” he answered in the
softest of whispers. “How?” I asked. “Well, he killed a
man yesterday and then robbed him,” said the policeman. I
hurriedly expressed my regret to my new acquaintance, and
said that I must at all costs return to the station. “The policeman
has been lying to you,” said the man. “It’s a lie; it’s
only because I haven’t got a passport.” (This was not exactly
a recommendation in itself.) I went into the first-class waiting-room.
The man came and sat down next to me, and now that
I examined his face I saw that he had the expression and the
stamp of countenance of a born thief. One of the waiters came
and told him to go, and he flatly refused, and the waiter made a
low bow to him. Then, gently but firmly, I advised him to go
away, as it might lead to trouble. He finally said: “All right,
but we shall meet in the train, in liberty.” He went away, but
he sent an accomplice, who stood behind my chair. He, too,
had the expression of a thief.</p>

<p>After waiting for several hours I approached the train for
Yaroslav. Just as I was getting in, a small boy came up to me
and said in a whisper: “The policeman sent me to tell you that
the man is a well-known thief, that he robs people every day,
and that he gets into the train, even into the first-class carriages,
and robs people, and he is after you now.” I entered a first-class
carriage and told the guard there was a thief about. I
had not been there long before the accomplice arrived and
began walking up and down the corridor. But the guard, I
am happy to say, turned him out instantly, and I saw nothing
more of the thief or of his accomplice.</p>

<p>A railway company director, or rather a man who was
arranging the purchase of a line, got into the carriage and began
at once to harangue me about the Government and say that
the way in which it had changed the election law was a piece of
insolence and would only make everybody more radical. Then
he told me that life in Yaroslav was simply intolerable, because
all newspapers and all free discussion had been stopped. We
arrived at Yaroslav on the next morning. I went on to Moscow
in a third-class carriage. The train stopped at every small
station, and there was a constant flow of people coming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
going. An old gentleman of the middle class sat opposite
to me for a time, and read a newspaper in an audible whisper.
Whenever he came to some doings of the Government he said:
“Disgraceful, disgraceful!”</p>

<p>Later on in the day a boy of seventeen got into the train.
He carried a large box. I was reading a book by Gogol, and
had put it down for a moment on the seat. He took it up and
said: “I am very fond of reading books.” I asked him how he
had learnt. He said he had been at school for one year, and
had then learnt at home. He could not stay at school as he
was the only son, his father was dead, and he had to look after
his small sisters; he was a stone quarrier, and life was very hard.
He loved reading. In winter the <i>mouzhiks</i> came to him and he
read aloud to them. His favourite book was called <i>Ivan
Mazeppa</i>. What that work may be, I did not know. I gave him
my Gogol. I have never seen anyone so pleased. He began
to read it—at the end—then and there, and said it would last
for several evenings. When he got out he said: “I will never
forget you,” and he took out of his pocket a lot of sunflower
seeds and gave them to me. As we neared Moscow the carriage
was fuller and fuller. Two peasants had no railway tickets.
One of them asked me if I would lend my ticket to him to show
the guard. I said: “With pleasure; only, my ticket is for Moscow
and yours is for the next station.” When the guard came, one
of the peasants gave him 30 kopecks. “That is very little
for two of you,” the guard said. They had been travelling
nearly all the way from Yaroslav; but finally he let them be.
We arrived at Moscow in the evening.</p>

<p>I travelled back to St. Petersburg in a third-class carriage,
which was full of recruits. “They sang all the way” (as Jowett
said about the poetical but undisciplined undergraduate<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> whom
he drove home from a dinner-party) “bad songs—very bad
songs.” Not quite all the way, however. They were like schoolboys
going to a private school, putting on extra assurance. In
the railway carriage there was a Zemstvo “Feldsher,” a hospital
orderly, who had been through the war. We talked of the war.
While we were discussing it, a young peasant who was in the
carriage joined in, and startled us by his sensible and acute
observations on the war. “There’s a man,” said the Feldsher
to me, “who has a good head. It is sheer natural cleverness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
That’s what a lot of the young peasants are like. And
what will become of him? If only these people could be
developed!” A little later I began to read a small book.
“Are you reading Lermontov?” asked the Feldsher, “No,”
I answered, “I am reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets.” “Ah,”
he said, with a sigh, “you are evidently not a married man, but
perhaps you are engaged to be married?”</p>

<p>Just as I was preparing to sleep, the guard came and began
to search the corners and the floor of the carriage with a candle,
as if he had dropped a pin or a penny. He explained that
there were twelve recruits in the carriage, but that an extra
man had got in with them and that he was looking for him.
He then went away. One of the recruits explained to me that
the man was under one of the seats, and hidden by boxes, as he
wished to go to St. Petersburg without a ticket. I went to
sleep. But the guard came back and turned me carefully over
to see if I was the missing man. Then he began to look again
in the most unlikely places for a man to be hid. He gave up
the search twice, but the hidden man could not resist putting
out his head to see what was happening, and before he could
get it back the guard coming in at that moment caught sight of
him. The man was turned out, but he got into the train again,
and the next morning it was discovered that he had stolen one
of the recruits’ boxes and some article of property from nearly
everybody in the carriage, including hats and coats. This he
had done while the recruits slept, for when they stopped
singing and went to sleep they slept soundly. Later in the
night, a huge and old peasant entered the train and crept under
the seat opposite to me. The guard did not notice him, and
after the tickets had been collected from the passengers who
got in at that station, the man crept out, and lay down on one
of the higher berths. He remained there nearly all night, but
at one of the stations the guard said: “Is there no one for this
station?” and looking at the peasant, added: “Where are you
for, old man?” The man mumbled in pretended sleep. “Where
is your ticket?” asked the guard. No answer. At last when the
question had been repeated thrice, he said: “I am a poor, little,
old man.” “You haven’t got a ticket,” said the guard. “Get
out, devil; you might lose me my place—and I a married man.
Devil! Devil! Devil!” “It is on account of my extreme
poverty,” said the old man, and he was turned out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I had a long conversation with the young
peasant who, the Feldsher said, had brains. I asked him,
among other things, if he thought the Government was right
in relying on what it called the innate and fundamental conservatism
of the great mass of the Russian people. “If the
Government says that the whole of the peasantry is Conservative,
it lies,” he said. “It is true that a great part of the
people is rough—uneducated—but there are many who know.
The war opened our eyes. You see, the Russian peasant is
accustomed to be told by the authorities that a glass (taking
up my tumbler) is a man, and to believe it. The Army is on
the side of the Government. At least it is really on the side
of the people, but it feels helpless. The Government will
never yield except to force. There is nothing to be done.” We
talked of other things. The recruits joined in the conversation,
and I offered a small meat patty to one of them, who said:
“No, thank you. I am greatly satisfied with you as it is,
without your giving me a meat patty.”</p>

<p>The theft which had taken place in the night was discussed
from every point of view. “We took pity on him and we hid
him,” they said, “and he robbed us.” They spoke of it without
any kind of bitterness or grievance, and nobody said:</p>

<p>“I told you so.” Then we arrived at St. Petersburg.</p>

<span class="smaller">TRAVEL IN RUSSIA</span></h2>

<p>After Christmas, the second Duma was convened
and opened. Its doings were not interesting. It
was not a representative body, as the elections had
been carefully arranged; still it was better than nothing,
and the very existence of a Duma of any kind exercised a
negative effect on matters in general. The Government could
be interpellated. Questions could be asked. The officials in
the country knew that their doings could be discussed in the
Duma, and this acted as a check. In April 1907, I had an
interview with Count Witte. Witte was a large, tall, burly
figure, with slightly ravaged features, intelligent eyes, the
facile opportunism and the deep-seated scepticism of those
who have had a long experience of affairs, of the ruling of men,
and the vicissitudes of political life. He received me abruptly,
and with a manner that, far from being ingratiating, seemed to
express the unspoken thought, “Why have you come to bother
me,” but as the conversation went on he melted and became
charming.</p>

<p>The first question he asked me was why I stayed such a
long time in Russia, I said it was because it interested me.
I then said: “Things seem to be going better.” “Do you
think so?” he asked, with a look of amused scepticism. I
asked him what he thought of the doings of the Extreme Right,
the reactionaries, who were now playing a noisy and important
part in political and social life.</p>

<p>He said they were a great danger. The Government would
never dare to touch them. He said both the Right and the
Kadets had lost faith in him. The Kadets because he had
not given them the key of the fortress, and the reactionaries
because he had not hung all the Liberals. He talked of
the Jewish question, and said that the Jews had begged him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
not to give them full rights, as they dreaded the consequences
of a sudden act of that kind. He said he had always thought
it impossible to give the Jews full rights all at once. He said
the Kadets were guilty of all that had happened in Russia in
the last year, because they had refused to support him when
he was Prime Minister, and had been unwilling to help him.
Had they done so he might have done a great deal. He then
talked of Stolypin. He said Stolypin was an honest man, with
no foresight, and a fatalist. “You can’t govern if you are a
<i>fatalist</i>,” he said, with a gesture of contempt. He said the
present electoral law was a farce, and that the only alternative
was to change it or to go back to the pre-Duma state of affairs;
and that would not last long. He said that the Kadets recognised
their mistakes now, and their failure, and he heard
from all quarters they were willing to accept his leadership now,
but it was too late. For a thousand reasons he would never
take office again after what he had gone through. I asked him
how the funds had been obtained for the great general strike.
He said it had all been prepared when Plehve was Minister, and
had been kept secret. He said he considered the situation in
October to have been one of real revolution, as there were then
no troops available to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>The impression he gave me was of disillusion, indifference,
fatigue, and invincible pessimism. He evidently thought that
whatever steps would be taken would be fatal, and he was
perfectly right.</p>

<p>In May I went back to London and stayed there till the
middle of July, when I came back to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>I then started for a journey down the Volga. I went by
train from St. Petersburg to Ribinsk. On the way to Ribinsk
my carriage was occupied by a party of workmen, including
a carpenter and a wheelwright, who were going to work on
somebody’s property in the Government of Tver; they did
not know whose property, and they did not know whither
they were going. They were under the authority of an old
man who came and talked to me, because, he said, the company
of the youths who were with him was tedious. He told
me a great many things, but as he was hoarse, and the train
made a rattling noise, I could not hear a word he said. There
were also in the carriage two Tartars and a small boy about
thirteen years old, who had a domineering character and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
himself in charge of the carriage. The discomfort of travelling
third-class in Russia was not the accommodation, but the frequent
awakenings during the night caused by passengers coming in
and by the guard asking for one’s ticket. The small boy with
the domineering character—he wore an old military cap on
the back of his head as a sign of strength of purpose—contributed
in no small degree to the general discomfort. He
apparently was in no need of sleep. He went from passenger
to passenger telling them where they would have to change
and where they would have to get out, and offering to open
the window if needed. I had a primitive candlestick made
of a candle stuck into a bottle; it fell on my head just as I
went to sleep, so I put it on the floor and went to sleep again.
But the small boy came and waked me, and told me that my
bottle was on the floor, and that he had put it back again.
I thanked him, but directly he was out of sight I put it back
again on the floor, and before long he came back, waked me a
second time—and told me that my candlestick had again
fallen down. This time I told him, not without emphasis,
to leave it alone, and I went to sleep again. But the little
boy was not defeated; he waked me again with the information
that a printed advertisement had fallen out of the book
I had been reading on to the floor. This time I told him
that if he waked me again I should throw him out of the
window.</p>

<p>Later in the night a tidy-looking man of the middle-class
entered the carriage with his wife. They began to chatter,
and to complain of the length of the benches, the officious
boy with the domineering character lending them his sympathy
and advice. This went on till one of the Tartars could bear
it no longer, and he called out in a loud voice that if they
wanted beds six yards long they had better not travel in a
train, and that they were making everybody else’s sleep
impossible. I blessed that Tartar not unawares, and after
that there was peace.</p>

<p>Towards ten o’clock in the morning we arrived at Ribinsk,
and there I embarked on a steamer to go down the Volga, as
far as Nijni-Novgorod. I took a first-class ticket and received
a clean deck cabin, containing a leather sofa (with no blankets
or sheets) and a washing-stand with a fountain tap. We
started at two o’clock in the afternoon. There were few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
passengers on board. The Volga was not what I had expected
it would be like—what place is? I had imagined a vast
expanse of water in an illimitable plain, instead of which there
was a broad, brown river, with green, shelving though not
steep banks, wooded with birch trees and fir trees and many
kinds of shrubs; sometimes the banks consisted of sloping
pastures and sometimes of cornfields. In the evening we
arrived at Yaroslav, a picturesque little city on the top of a
steep bank. All day long the sky had been grey and heavy,
with long, piled-up clouds, but the sun, as it set, made for itself
a thin strip of gold beneath the grey masses, and when it had
sunk, the masses themselves glinted like armour, and the strip
beneath became a stretch of pure and luminous twilight. In
the twilight the town was seen at its best. I went ashore
and walked about the streets of the quiet city; a sleepy
town, with trees and grass everywhere (the trees dark in the
twilight); the houses low, two-storied, and painted white,
with pale green roofs, ghostlike in the dusk, ornamented
with pilasters, eighteenth-century and Empire arches and
arcades. Every now and then one came across a church with
gilt minarets glistening in what remained of the sunset.
The whole was a symphony in dark green, white, and lilac
(the sky was lilac by now). The shops were shut, the
houses shuttered, the passers-by few. The grass grew thick
on the cobble-stones. I wandered about thinking how well
Vernon Lee would seize on the <i>genius loci</i> of this sleepy
city, dreaming in the lilac July twilight, with its alternate
vistas of luminous white houses and dark glooms of trees.
How she would extract the spirit of the place, and find the
exact note in other places which it corresponded with, whether
in Gascony, or Tuscany, or Bavaria; and I reflected that all
I could do would be to say I had seen Yaroslav—I had walked
about in it—and that it was a picturesque city.</p>

<p>We left Yaroslav at eleven at night. In the dining-room
of the steamer I had left a Tauchnitz volume called <i>Fräulein
Schmidt und Mr. Anstruther</i>, by the author of <i>Elizabeth and
her German Garden</i>. I was looking forward to reading this
before going to sleep; but this was not to be. The volume
had disappeared. The next morning the matter was explained.
There was a family travelling in the steamer, consisting of a
mother, a daughter, and a son. The mother was young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
looking, although both the daughter and son were grown up;
they had found the book, and thought (I suppose) it had been
left behind, or that it belonged to the public library. The
book occupied them for the rest of the journey. They talked
of nothing else. The mother had read it before. The daughter
must have sat up late reading it, because she handed it over
to the son early in the morning. They all thought it
interesting, but they evidently disagreed about it. These
are the things which ought to please an author.</p>

<p>We reached Nijni-Novgorod the next morning at eight. I
took a cab. “Drive,” I said, “to the best hotel.” “There is
the Hôtel Rossia at the top of the town, and the Hôtel Petersburg
at the bottom,” the cabman answered. “Which is the
best?” I asked. “The Hôtel Rossia is the best at the top
of the town,” he answered, “and the Hôtel Petersburg is the
best at the bottom.” “Which is the most central?” I asked.
“The Rossia is the most central at the top, and the Petersburg
is the most central at the bottom.” “Which is nearest the
Fair?” “They are neither near the Fair.” “Are there no
hotels near the Fair?” “There are no hotels near the Fair
<i>in the town</i>.”</p>

<p>We drove to the Rossia, a long way up a very steep hill,
past the Kremlin—a hill like Windsor Hill, only twice as long.
The Kremlin is like Windsor, supposing the outside walls of
Windsor had never been restored and the castle were taken
away. When we got to the hotel the cabman said: “This
part of the town is deserted in summer; nobody lives here;
everybody lives near the Fair.” “But I said I wanted to be
in the Fair,” I answered. “Oh!” he answered; “of course
if you want to be <i>in</i> the Fair there are plenty of hotels in the
Fair.” So we drove down again, right into the lower part of
the town, and thence across a large wooden bridge into the Fair.</p>

<p>Nijni-Novgorod occupies both sides of the Volga. On one
side there is a steep hill, a Kremlin, and a town covering the
hill till it reaches the quays and extending along them;—on
the other side a huge plain and the Fair. The hill part of the
town is wooded and green; the Fair was a town in itself, and
during the Fair period the whole business of life—shops, including
hotels, theatres, banks, baths, post, exchange, restaurants—was
transferred thither. The shops were one-storied and occupied
square blocks, which they intersected in parallel lines. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
were of every description and quality, ranging from the supply
of the needs of the extremely rich to those of the extremely
poor. I found a room in an hotel. The hotels were crowded,
although I was told that the Fair had never been so
empty. It had not been open long, and merchants were still
arriving daily with their goods. The centre of the Fair was a
house called the “Glavnii Dom,” the principal house; here the
post and the police were concentrated, and the most important
shops—Fabergé, for instance. There were many dealers in
furs and skins; I bought nothing, in spite of great temptation,
except a blanket and a clothes-brush. The blankets
were dear. Star sapphires, on the other hand, seemed to be
as cheap as dirt. I never quite understood when the people
had their meals at the Fair. The restaurants, and there were
many, seemed to be empty all day; they were certainly full
all night. Perhaps the people did not eat during the daytime.
In every restaurant there was a theatrical performance, which
began at nine o’clock in the evening and went on until four
o’clock the next morning, with few interruptions; it consisted
mostly of singing and dancing.</p>

<p>What surprised and struck me most about the Fair was
the great size of it. I had not guessed that the Fair was a
large town consisting entirely of shops, hotels, and restaurants.
The most important merchandise that passed hands at the
Fair was furs. But there were goods of every variety:
second-hand books, tea, and silks from China, gems from the
Urals, and <i>art nouveau</i> furniture. There were also old curiosity
shops rich in church vestments, stiff copes and jewelled
chasubles, which would be found most useful by those people
who like to furnish their drawing-rooms entirely with objects
diverted from their proper use; that is to say, teapots made
out of musical instruments and old book bindings. Nijni,
during the Fair, was almost entirely inhabited by merchants—merchants
of every kind and description. The majority
of them wore loose Russian shirts and top-boots. I noticed
that at Nijni it did not in the least signify how untidily
one was dressed; however untidy one looked, one was sure of
being treated with respect, because slovenliness at Nijni did
not necessarily imply poverty, and the people of the place
justly reasoned that however sordid our exterior appearance
might be, there was no knowing but it might clothe a millionaire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Another thing which struck me here, a thing which has
struck me in several other places, was the way in which people
determined your nationality by your clothes. While they paid
no attention to <i>degree</i> in the matter of clothes at Nijni, as to
whether they were shabby or new, they paid a great deal of
attention to kind. For instance, the day I arrived I was wearing
an ordinary English straw hat. This headgear caused quite
a sensation amongst the sellers of Astrakan fur. They crowded
round me, crying out: “Vairy nice, vairy cheap, Engleesh.”
I bought a different kind of hat, a white yachting cap, and
loose silk Russian shirt, such as the merchants wore.</p>

<p>That evening I went to a restaurant at which there was a
musical performance. I fell into conversation with a young
merchant sitting at the next table, and he said to me after we
had had some conversation: “You are, I suppose, from the
Caucasus.” I said “No.” We talked of other things, the
Far East among other topics. He then exclaimed: “You are,
I suppose, from the Far East.” I again said “No,” and we
again talked of other things. He had some friends with him
who joined in the conversation, and they were consumed with
curiosity as to whence I had come, and I told them they could
guess. They guessed various places, such as Archangel, Irkutsk,
Warsaw, and Saghalien, and at last one of them cried out with
joy: “I know what place you belong to; you are a native of
Nijni.” They went away triumphant. Their place was taken
by a very old merchant, a rugged, grey-haired, bearded peasant.
He looked on at the singing and dancing which was taking
place on the stage for some time, and then he said to me:
“Don’t you wish you were twenty years younger?” I
said I did, but I did not think that I should in that case be
better equipped for this particular kind of entertainment, as
I should be only twelve years old. “Impossible!” said the
old man indignantly. “You are quite bald, and bear every
sign of old age.”</p>

<p>I left Nijni on the wrong steamer—that is to say, by a line
I did not mean to patronise, because I knew it was the worst.
There was no help for it, because my passport was not ready
in time. I took a first-class cabin on a big steamer full of
children with their nurses and parents. The children ran about
the cabin all day long without stopping. Children, I noticed,
are the same all over the world: they play the same games,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
they make the same noise. In this case there were five sisters
and a small brother. What reminded me much of all children
in general, and of my own experience as a child in particular,
was that the boy suddenly began to howl because his sisters
wouldn’t let him play with them, and he cried out: “I want to
play too”; and the sisters, when the matter was finally brought
before an arbitration court of parents, who were playing cards,
said that the boy made all games impossible. Also there
were three nurses in the cabin, who, whatever the children did,
told them not to do it; and every now and then one heard
familiar phrases such as “Don’t sit on the oilcloth with your
bare legs.” “Don’t lean out of the window with that cold
of yours.” The passengers on the boat were uninteresting.</p>

<p>There was a couple who spoke bad French to each other
out of refinement, but who relapsed into Russian when they
had really something interesting to say. There was a student
who played the pianoforte with astonishing facility and amazing
execution; there were the elder sisters of the small children,
who also played the pianoforte in exactly the same way as young
people play it in England—that is to say, with convulsive jerks
over the difficult passages, and uninterrupted insistence on the
loud pedal, and a foolish bass. The grown-up members of
the party played “Vindt” all day.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Kazan I got out to look at the town.
It also possesses a Kremlin with white walls and crenellated
towers and old churches, a museum of uninteresting objects,
and a large monastery. It was the most stagnant-looking city.</p>

<p>The Volga beyond Nijni is considerably broader. It is never
less than 1200 yards in breadth, and from Nijni onwards, on the
right bank of the river, there is a range of lofty hills, mostly
wooded, but sometimes rocky and grassy, which go sheer down
into the river. The left bank is flat, and consists of green
meadows. Below Kazan it is joined by the river Kama, and
becomes a mighty river, never less than three-quarters of a
mile in breadth. In various parts of its course the Volga
reminded me of almost every river I had ever seen, from
the Dart to the Liao-he, and from the Neckar to the Nile.
Below Kazan its aspect was gloomy and sombre, a great
stretch of broad brown waters, a wooded mountainous bank
on one side, a monotonous plain on the other. But when the
weather was fine—and it was gloriously fine after we reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Kazan—the effects of light on the great expanse of water were
miraculous. It is at dawn that you feel the magic of these
waters; at dawn and at sunset when the great broad expanse,
turning to gold or to silver, according as the sky is crimson,
mauve, or rosy and grey, has a mystery and majesty of its own.
We met other steamers on the way, but during the whole voyage
from Nijni to Astrakan we only passed two small sailing boats.</p>

<p>I got out at Samara and spent the night at an hotel. The
next day I embarked again for Astrakan, after having explored
the town, in which I failed to find an object of interest. From
Samara to Saratov the hills on the right bank of the river
diminish in size, and instead of descending sheer into the river,
they slope away from it; and as the hills diminish, the vegetation
grows more scanty. The left bank is flat and monotonous as
before. From Samara to Saratov I travelled third-class, to
see what it was like on board the steamer. There are on the
steamer four official classes and an unofficial fifth-class. The
third-class have a general cabin on the lower deck with two tiers
of bunks. The fourth-class have a kind of enclosure, which
contains one large broad board on which they encamp. The
fourth-class contains the “steerage” passengers. It is indescribably
dirty. The fifth-class is composed of still dirtier
and still poorer people, who lie about on boxes, bales, or on
whatever vacant space they can find on the lower deck. They
lie, for the most part, like corpses, in a profound slumber, generally
face downwards, flat upon the floor. The third-class is
respectable and decently clean; it has, moreover, one immense
advantage—some permanently open windows. In the first-class
there was among the company a great aversion to draughts.
They had not what someone once called “La passion des Anglais
pour les courants d’air.” In the third-class there was no such
prejudice. The passengers were various. There were two
students, some merchants, twenty Cossacks going home on
leave, a policeman, a public servant, several peasants, and a
priest.</p>

<p>On the bunk just over mine sprawled a large bearded
Cossack, who at once asked me where I was going, my occupation,
my country, and my name. I told him that I was a
newspaper correspondent and an Englishman. I then lay
down on my bunk. Another Cossack from the other side of the
cabin called out at the top of his voice to the man who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
over me: “Who is that man?” “He is a foreigner.” “Is
he travelling with goods?” “No; he is just travelling, nothing
more.” “Where does he come from?” “I don’t know.”
Then, looking down at me from his bunk, the Cossack who was
above me said: “Thou art quite bald, little father. Is it illness
that did it, or nature?” “Nature,” I answered. “Shouldst
try an ointment,” he said. “I have tried many and strong
ointments,” I said, “including onion, tar, and paraffin, none of
which were of any avail. There is nothing to be done.” “No,”
said the Cossack, with a sigh. “There is nothing to be done.
It is God’s business.”</p>

<p>There was no particular discomfort in travelling third-class
in the steamer. The bunks, with the aid of blankets, were as
comfortable as those in the first-class. One could obtain the
same food, and there was plenty of fresh air. Nevertheless,
if one only travelled thus for a day and a night, it was indescribably
fatiguing, because one had to change and readjust
one’s hours. For at the first streak of dawn, the people began
to talk, and by sunrise they had washed and were having tea.
It is not as if they went to bed earlier. For all day long they
talked, and they went to sleep quite late, about eleven. But
they had the blessed gift, possessed by Napoleon, of snatching
half-hours or five minutes of sleep whenever they felt in need
of it. If one travelled like this for several days running, one
got used to it, of course, and one also acquired the habit of
snatching sleep at odd moments during the daytime; but if one
travelled like this for a day or two, it was, as I have said
already, extremely tiring.</p>

<p>The public servant, who had a small post in some provincial
town, came and talked to me. He asked me if Chaliapine, the
famous singer, had sung at Nijni. Chaliapine, he added, was
his master. “I have,” he said, “a magnificent bass voice.”
“Are you fond of music?” I asked. “Fond of music!” he
cried. “When I hear music I am like a wild animal. I go
mad.” “Do you mean to go on the stage?” I asked. “Yes,”
he said, “when I have learnt enough. In the meantime I am
a public servant—I am in the Government service.” “That,
I suppose, you find tedious?” I said. “It is more than tedious;
it is disgusting,” and he began to abuse the Government. I
said: “There is a great difference between the Russia of to-day
and the Russia of four years ago.” “There is no difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
at all,” he said; “we have obtained absolutely nothing except
paper promises.” I said: “I am not talking of what the Government
has done or failed to do; I am talking of the general
aspect of things, of Russian life as it strikes a foreigner. I was
here three or four years ago, and I am struck by the great
difference between then and now. Had I met you then, you
would not have talked politics with me; there were no politics
to talk.” “That is true,” he answered; “we have now a
political life.”</p>

<p>Here one of the Cossacks asked him who he was. “I am a
famous singer,” he answered. “I have sung at the Merchants’
Club at the district town of A⸺. I am a pupil of Chaliapine,
who is the king of basses and is well known throughout the
whole civilised world, and who has sung in America. He is a
Russian. Think of that.” The Cossack seemed impressed.
The singer got out at one of the stations.</p>

<p>The people in the cabin had their meals at different times
of the day; the chief meal was tea, which took place twice a
day. Every time we stopped at a place a crowd of beggars
invaded our cabin asking for alms. The interesting point is
that they received them. They were never sent empty away,
and were invariably given either some coppers, some bread, or
some melon. I am sure there is no country in the world where
people give so readily to the poor as in Russia. One had only
to walk about the streets in any Russian town to notice this
fact. Here in the third-class saloon it especially struck me.
I did not see one single beggar turned away without a gift of
some kind. One little boy was given a piece of bread and a
large slice of water-melon.</p>

<p>At the many small stations at which we called on the banks
of the river there were crowds of itinerant vendors selling
various descriptions of food—hot pies, fried fish, gigantic
water-melons, apples, red currants, and cucumbers. The
whole duration of each stop at any of these places was occupied
by the unloading and loading of the steamer with goods. This
was done by a horde of creatures in red and blue shirts called
loaders, who had a kind of ledge strapped on to their backs
which enabled them to support enormous loads. Like big
gnomes, during the whole of the stop, they scurried from the
hold of the steamer to the wooden quay and back again to the
steamer. On the quay itself, either placidly looking on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
munching sunflower seeds, or else wildly gesticulating over a
bargain at a booth, a motley herd of passengers and inhabitants
of the place swarmed: many-coloured, bright, ragged, and
squalid, like the crowds depicted in a sacred picture waiting
for a miracle or a parable under the burning sky of Palestine.</p>

<p>Samara and Saratov have not the features which characterise
the towns of the Upper Volga. They have no Kremlin, no
remains of a fortress dominating the town and enclosed in old
walls. Saratov is a collection of wooden houses which look as
if they had been made by a Swiss artisan for the Earl’s Court
Exhibition and exposed on the side of a steep hill.</p>

<p>Between Saratov and Tzaritsin the character of the river
changes altogether, the vegetation begins to dwindle; the great
hills on the right bank of the river diminish, and the farther one
travels south, the lower they become. The left bank is flat,
monotonous, and green as before. The river itself broadens,
and in some places it is several kilometres wide. You get the
impression that you are travelling on a large lake or on a sea,
rather than on a river. The farther south one travels, the
greater is the beauty of the river. It is a solemn, majestic
river; one understands its having been the mother and inspirer
of a quantity of poetry, of folk-song and folk-lore; and
one understands, too, how appropriate the deep octaves, the
broad, slow-dying notes and echoes of the Volga songs are to
these great, melancholy spaces of shining water. Every day
on the steamer between Saratov and Astrakan I awoke at dawn
and went out on to the deck to sniff the freshness and to watch
the process of daybreak. The soft, grey sky trembled into a
delicate tint of lilac, and over the far-off banks of the river,
which were distant enough to have the appearance of a range
of <i>violet</i> hills, came the first blush of dawn, and then a deeper
rose, while the whole upper sky was washed with a clean
daffodil colour, which was reflected in silver on the blue water.
And then the sun rose—a huge red ball of fire, casting golden
scales beneath him on to the water.</p>

<p>Towards noon, perhaps, the sky would be piled with white
clouds, and the river look like an immense hard glass, reflecting
in unruffled detail every curve and shadow of the cloudland,
and the small motionless trees of the banks which in the sunless
heat are as unreal as a mirage. Later in the afternoon the
water seemed to grow more and more luminous; the sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
of some kind of enchantment, of something wizard-like and unreal,
increased, and one would not have been surprised to catch
sight of the walls of Tristram’s Castle-in-the-air, the wizard walls,
to which he promised to bring Iseult—the castle built of the
stuff which rainbows are made of, of fire, dew, and the colours
of the morning. But with the sunset this feeling of unreality
and enchantment ceased; the nearer bank stood out in sharp
outline, intensely real, between purple skies and grey waters;
and over the farther bank hung the intense blue of woody
distances. Between Tzaritsin and Astrakan the character
of the river changes yet again. The hills on the right bank
vanish altogether; both the banks were flat now—unlimited
steppes with scant vegetation, culminating in steep banks of
yellow sand. It was here that the river reminded me of
the Nile.</p>

<p>Tzaritsin itself is a great trade centre; the best caviare
and the best water-melons used to be obtained there. Most of
the third-class passengers got out at Tzaritsin. I was amused
by the process, which I watched on shore, of a huge block
of stone being hauled up a hill by a gang of workmen.
The spectacle was so utterly unlike anything in other
countries. Pieces of rock are also hauled up hills in other
lands, but the manner in which it is done is different. Seven
men were hauling the rope; they were ragged, dirty, and
dressed in red and blue shirts, stained and dusty, while
their tufts of yellow hair stuck out of their tattered peaked
caps. By the block of stone stood the leader of the gang.
Then suddenly, when he thought the time had come, he intoned
a chant, a solo, about fifteen notes, which might have been
written in the Scotch scale (the scale of G major without the
F sharp), plaintive and unexpected; then he beat time with a
wave of his left hand, and at the fourth beat, the whole gang
chimed in, imitating the melody in a rough counterpoint, and
hauling as they sang, and then abruptly ending on the dominant.
After a short pause, the leader again intoned his solo and the
chorus again repeated and imitated the plaintive melody, and
this was repeated till the block of stone was hauled up the
hill.</p>

<p>The climate, when Tzaritsin was passed, grew hotter and
hotter, and the breeze made by the steamer only increased the
heat. The moon rose, and for a while the sky was still tinged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
with the stain of the sunset in the west, and the water was
luminous with a living whiteness. Then, rapidly, because the
twilight did not last long here, came the darkness, and with it
something strange and wonderful. We became conscious of an
extraordinary fragrance in the air. It was not merely the
sweetness of summer night. It was a pungent and aromatic
incense which pervaded the atmosphere—warm and delicious
and filled with the essence of summer. It was intoxicating;
it came over you like a great wave, a breath of Elysium.
And the night with its web of stars, and the dark waters,
and the thin line of the far-off banks, made you once more
lose the sense of reality. You had reached another world—the
nether-world, perhaps; you breathed “the scent of alien
meadows far away,” and you felt as if you were sailing down
the river of oblivion to the harbours of Proserpine. This
wonderful sweetness came, I learnt, from the new-mown hay,
the mowing of which takes place late here. The hay lay in
great masses over the steppes, embalming the midnight air and
turning the world into paradise.</p>

<p>On reaching Astrakan, you were plunged into the atmosphere
of the East. On the quays there were many booths groaning
with every kind of fruit, and a coloured herd of people
living in the dust and the dirt; splendidly squalid, noisy
as parrots, and busy doing nothing, like wasps. The railway
to Astrakan was not yet finished, so you were obliged
to return to Tzaritsin by steamer if you wished to get back
to the centre of Russia. I pursued this course, and from
Tzaritsin took the train for Tambov. The train started from
Tzaritsin at two o’clock in the morning; I arrived at the station
at midnight, and at this hour the station was crammed with
people. Imagine a huge high waiting-room with three tables
d’hôte parallel to each other in the centre of it; at one end
of the hall a buffet; on the sides of it, under the windows,
tables and long seats padded with leather, partitioned off and
forming open cubicles. These seats were always occupied,
and the occupants went to bed on them, wrapped up in blankets,
and propped up by pillows, bags, rugs, baskets, kettles, and
other impedimenta. The whole of this refreshment hall was
filled with sleeping figures. There were people lying asleep on
the window-sills, and others on chairs placed together. Some
merely laid their heads on the table d’hôte, and fell into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
deep slumber. It was like the scene in <i>The Sleeping Beauty
in the Wood</i>, when sleep overtook the inhabitants of the castle.
There was a bookstall and a newspaper kiosk. The bookstall
contained—as usual—the works of Jerome K. Jerome and
Conan Doyle, some translations of French novels, some political
pamphlets, a translation of John Morley’s <i>Compromise</i>, and an
essay on Ruskin—a strange medley of literary food. At the
newspaper kiosk, the newsvendor was so busily engrossed in
reading out a story, which had just appeared in the newspapers,
about a saintly peasant who killed a baby because he thought it
was the Antichrist, that it was impossible to attract his attention.
His audience were the policeman, one of the porters, and
a kind of sub-guard. The story was indeed a curious one, and
caused a considerable stir. I wrote about it later on in the
<i>Morning Post</i>. ’</p>

<p>The journey to Tambov was long; in my carriage a railway
official drank tea, ate apples, and sighed over the political
condition of the country. Everything was as bad as bad
could be. “It is a sad business,” he said, “living in Russia
now.” Then, after some reflection, he added: “But, perhaps
in other countries—in England, for instance—people sometimes
find fault with the Government.” I told him they did little
else. He then took a large roll out of a basket, and after he
had been munching it for some time, he said: “After all, there
is no country in the world where such good bread can be got
as this.” This seemed to console him greatly.</p>

<p>The sunflower season had arrived. Sunflowers used to be
grown in great quantities in Russia, not for ornamental but
for utilitarian purposes. They were grown for the oil that
is in them; but besides being useful in many ways they
formed an article of food. You pick the head of the sunflower
and eat the seeds. You bite the seed, spit out the
husk, and eat the kernel, which is white and tastes of sunflower.
Considerable skill is needed when cracking the husk
and spitting it out, to leave the kernel intact. This habit was
universal among the lower classes in Russia. It occupies a
human being like smoking, and it is a pleasant adjunct to
contemplation. It is also conducive to untidiness. Nothing
is so untidy in the world as a room or a platform littered with
sunflower seeds. All platforms in Russia were thus, littered
at this time of year. When I was on the steamer at Tzaritsin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
one of the Cossacks approached me with this question, which
seemed startling: “Do you chew seeds?” At first I was at a
loss to think what he meant, but I soon remembered the sunflower,
and when I had answered in the affirmative, he produced
a great handful of dried seeds and offered them to me. When
I arrived at my destination, Sosnofka, in the government of
Tambov, I found the country looking intensely green after a
wet summer; the weather was hot, and the nights had the
softness and the sweetness that should belong to the month
of June.</p>

<p>I found a large crowd at the station gathered round a pillar
of smoke and flame. At first I thought, of course, that a village
fire was going on. Fires in Russian villages were common
occurrences in the summer, and this was not surprising, as
the majority of the houses were thatched with straw. The
houses were so close one to another, and the ground was
littered with straw. Moreover, to set fire to one’s neighbour’s
house used to be a common form of paying off a score. But it
was not a fire that was in progress. It was the casting of a bell.
The ceremony was fixed for four o’clock in the afternoon, with
due solemnity and with religious rites, and I was invited to be
present.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Heute muss die Glocke werden,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">wrote Schiller in his famous poem, and here the words were
appropriate. This day the bell was to be. It was a blazing
hot day. The air was dry, the ground was dry, everything was
dry, and the great column of smoke mixed with flame issuing
from the furnace added to the heat. The furnace had been
made exactly opposite to the church. The church was a
stone building with a Doric portico, four red columns, a
white pediment, a circular pale green roof, and a Byzantine
minaret. The village of Sosnofka had wooden log-built cottages
thatched with straw dotted over the rolling plain. The plain
was variegated with woods—oak trees and birch being the
principal trees—and stretched out infinitely into the blue
distance. Before the bell was to be cast a Te Deum was to be
sung.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday, the day of the bazaar. The bazaar in
the village of Somotka was the mart, where the buying and
selling of meat, provisions, fruit, melons, fish, hardware, iron-mongery,
china, and books were conducted. It happened once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
a week on Wednesdays, and peasants flocked in from the
neighbouring villages to buy their provisions. But that
afternoon the bazaar was deserted. The whole population of
the village had gathered together on the dry, brown, grassy
square in front of the church to take part in the ceremony.
At four o’clock two priests and a deacon, followed by a
choir (two men in their Sunday clothes), and by bearers of
gilt banners, walked in procession out of the church. They
were dressed in stiff robes of green and gold, and as they
walked they intoned a plain-song. An old card-table, with a
stained green cloth, was placed and opened on the ground
opposite, and not far from the church, and on this two lighted
tapers were set, together with a bowl of holy water. The
peasants gathered round in a semicircle with bare heads,
and joined in the service, making many genuflexions and signs
of the Cross, and joining in the song with their deep bass voices.
When I said the peasants, I should have said half of them.
The other half were gathered in a dense crowd round the
furnace, which was built of bricks, and open on both sides to
the east and to the west, and fed with wooden fuel. The
men in charge of the furnace stood on both sides of it and
stirred the molten metal it contained with two enormous poles.</p>

<p>On one side of the furnace a channel had been prepared
through which the metal was to flow into the cast of
the bell. The crowd assembled there was already struggling
to have and to hold a good place for the spectacle of
the release of the metal when the solemn moment should
arrive. Three policemen tried to restrain the crowd; that
is to say, one police officer, one police sergeant, and one
common policeman. They were trying with all their might
to keep back the crowd, so that when the metal was
released a disaster should not happen; but their efforts were
in vain, because the crowd was large, and when they pressed
back a small portion of it they made a dent in it which caused
the remaining part of it to bulge out; and it was the kind of
crowd—so intensely typical of Russia—on which no words,
whether of command, entreaty, or threat, made the smallest
impression. The only way to keep it back was by pressing on
it with the body and outstretched arms, and that only kept
back a tiny portion of it. In the meantime the Te Deum went
on and on; and many things and persons were prayed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
besides the bell which was about to be born. At one moment
I obtained a place from which I had a commanding view of
the furnace, but I was soon oozed out of it by the ever-increasing
crowd of men, women, and children.</p>

<p>The whole thing was something between a sacred picture
and a scene in a Wagner opera. The tall peasants with red
shirts, long hair, and beards, stirring the furnace with long
poles, looked like the persons in the epic of the <i>Niebelungen</i>
as we see it performed on the stage to the strains of a complicated
orchestration. There was Wotan in a blue shirt, with
a spear; and Alberic, with a grimy face and a hammer, was
meddling with the furnace; and Siegfried, in leather boots
and sheepskin, was smoking a cigarette and waving an enormous
hammer; while Mimi, whining and disagreeable as usual, was
having his head smacked. On the other hand, the peasants
who were listening and taking part in the Te Deum, were like
the figures of a sacred picture—women with red-and-white
Eastern head-dresses, bearded men listening as though expecting
a miracle, and barefooted children, with straw-coloured
hair and blue eyes, running about everywhere. Towards six
o’clock the Te Deum at last came to an end, and the crowd
moved and swayed around the furnace. The Russian crowd
reminded me of a large tough sponge. Nothing seemed to
make any effect on it. It absorbed the newcomers who
dived into it, and you could pull it this way and press it
that way, but there it remained; indissoluble, passive, and
obstinate. Perhaps the same is true of the Russian nation;
I think it is certainly true of the Russian character, in
which there is so much apparent weakness and softness,
so much obvious elasticity and malleability, and so much
hidden passive resistance.</p>

<p>I asked a peasant who was sitting by a railing under the
church when the ceremony would begin. “Ask them,” he
answered; “they will tell you, but they won’t tell us.” With
the help of the policeman, I managed to squeeze a way through
the mass of struggling humanity to a place in the first row.
I was told that the critical moment was approaching, and was
asked to throw a piece of silver into the furnace, so that the
bell might have a tuneful sound. I threw a silver rouble into
the furnace, and the men who were in charge of the casting
said that the critical moment had come. On each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
small channel they fixed metal screens and placed a large
screen facing it. The man in charge said in a loud, matter-of-fact
tone: “Now, let us pray to God.” The peasants
uncovered themselves and made the sign of the Cross. A
moment was spent in silent prayer. This prayer was especially
for the success of the operation which was to take place immediately,
namely, the release of the molten metal. Two
hours had already been spent in praying for the bell. At this
moment the excitement of the crowd reached such a pitch
that they pushed themselves right up to the channel, and the
efforts of the policemen, who were pouring down with perspiration,
and stretching out in vain their futile arms, like the ghosts
in Virgil, were pathetic. One man, however, not a policeman,
waved a big stick and threatened to beat everybody
back if they did not make way. Then, at last, the culminating
moment came; the metal was released, and it poured down
the narrow channel which had been prepared for it, and over
which two logs placed crosswise formed an arch, surmounted
by a yachting cap, for ornament. A huge yellow sheet of flame
flared up for a moment in front of the iron screen facing the
channel. The women in the crowd shrieked. Those who were
in front made a desperate effort to get back, and those who
were at the back made a desperate effort to get forward,
and I was carried right through and beyond the crowd in
the struggle.</p>

<p>The bell was born. I hoped the silver rouble which I
threw into it, and which now formed a part of it, would sweeten
its utterance, and that it might never have to sound the alarm
which signifies battle, murder, and sudden death. A vain
hope—an idle wish.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUTH RUSSIA, JOURNALISM, LONDON</span></h2>

<p>In the autumn of 1907 I went for the first time to South
Russia. To Kharkov, and then to Gievko, a small
village in the neighbourhood, where I stayed with Prince
Mirski in his country house.</p>

<p>This was the first time I had visited Little Russia, that is
to say, Southern Russia. The contrast between Central and
Southern Russia is, I noted at the time, not unlike that
between Cambridgeshire and South Devon.</p>

<p>The vegetation was more or less the same in both places,
and in both places the season was marking the same hour, only
the hour was being struck in a different manner. In Central
Russia there was a bite in the morning air, a smell of smoke,
of damp leaves, of moist brown earth, and a haze hanging
on the tattered trees, which were generously splashed with
crimson and gold. In the south of Russia, little green remained
in the yellow and golden woods; the landscape was hot and
dry; there was no sharpness in the air and no moisture in the
earth; summer, instead of being conquered by the sharp wounds
of the invading cold, was dying like a decadent Roman Emperor
of excess of splendour, softness, and opulence. The contrast
in the houses was sharper still. In Central Russia the peasant’s
house is built of logs and roofed with straw or iron according
to the means of the inhabitant. The villages are brown, colourless,
and sullen; in the South the houses are white or pale
green; they have orchards and fruit trees, and sometimes a
glass verandah. There is something well-to-do and smiling
about them—something which reminds one of the whitewashed
cottages of South Devon or the farms in Normandy.</p>

<p>Prince Mirski lived in a long, low house, which gave one the
impression of a dignified, comfortable, and slightly shabby Grand
Trianon. The walls were grey, the windows went down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
ground, and opened on to a delightful view. You looked down
a broad avenue of golden trees, which framed a distant hill
in front of you, sloping down to a silver sheet of water. In the
middle of this brown hill there was a church painted white, with
a cupola and a spire on one side of it, and flanked on both sides
by two tall cypresses. There were many guests in the house:
relations, friends, neighbours. We met at luncheon—a large,
patriarchal meal—and after luncheon, Prince Mirski used to
play Vindt in the room looking down on to the view I have
described. Prince Mirski had been Minister of the Interior
for a short period in the autumn of 1905, and during his
period of office he had abolished all censorship of newspapers
previous to their publication. This act, which would not
seem at first sight to be momentous, had far-reaching effects.
Never could this censorship be restored again, and its removal
let in a flood of light to Russian life. It was the opening
of a small skylight into a darkened room. After that
nothing could ever be as it had been before. Prince Mirski
was a warm-hearted, welcoming host, and spoke a beautiful
easy Russian, and his great, saltlike good sense pervaded the
light rippling waves, or the lambent shafts of an urbane wit,
never heavy, never tedious, never lengthy, but always light,
always amiable, and yet never divorced from a strong fundamental
reasonableness. I was taken to see the little Russian
farms, which were painted green, and were as clean outside as
they were inside. Inside, the walls were painted red and blue,
the furniture was neatly arranged, and no hens nor other
live-stock shared the living-rooms. The inhabitants wore
no gorgeously picturesque South Russian costumes. There
were factories in the neighbourhood, and this was perhaps
the reason an air of Manchester and Birmingham had
invaded the fashions. The shirt and the collars of the <i>intelligentsia</i>
had spread downwards to the peasant population,
but every now and then one came across a picturesque
figure.</p>

<p>One day I met a blind beggar. He was sitting on a hill in
front of the church, and he was playing an instrument called a
“lira,” that is to say, a lyre.</p>

<p>It was a wooden instrument shaped exactly like a violin.
It had three strings, which were tuned with pegs, like those of a
violin, but it was played by fingering wooden keys, like those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
a large concertina, and by, at the same time, turning a handle
which protruded from the base of the instrument. The musician
said he could play any kind of music—sad, joyous, and sacred,
and he gave examples of all three of these styles; they were to
my ear indistinguishable in kind; they seemed to me all tinged
with the same quick and deliciously plaintive melody; and the
sound made by the instrument instantly suggested the melody
and the accompaniment of Schubert’s song: “Der Leiermann”;
the plaintive, comfortable noise of the first hurdy-gurdy
players. I found out afterwards this lyre was indeed the same
instrument as Schubert must have had in his mind. It was
the instrument that in Germany is called <i>Leierkasten</i>, in France
<i>vielle</i>, and in England, hurdy-gurdy; and my blind beggar was
just such a man as Schubert’s <i>Leiermann</i>.</p>

<p>After I had stayed some days at Gievko, I went farther
south to Kiev, and stayed at Smielo with Count André Bobrinsky.
Count Bobrinsky lived in a compound next to a large
beet-sugar factory. In the same compound various members
of the same family lived. Each member of the family had a
house of his own, and the whole clan were presided over and
ruled by an old Count Lev Bobrinsky.</p>

<p>Count Lev Bobrinsky was an old man of astonishing vigour
and activity, both of body and mind. He knew every detail
of all the affairs that were going on around him. He was
afraid of nothing, and once when he was attacked by a huge
hound he tackled and defeated the infuriated beast with his
hands, and broke the animal’s jaw.</p>

<p>All his family held him in wholesome respect not unmixed
with awe.</p>

<p>One day we went out shooting. Count Lev no longer shot
himself, but he organised every detail of the day’s sport, and
would come out to luncheon. We drove in a four-in-hand
harnessed to a light vehicle to the woods, which were most
beautiful. The trees had huge red stems. We were to shoot
roebuck with rifles. I was specially told not to shoot a doe.
While I was waiting there was a rustle in the undergrowth
and a shout from someone, which meant <i>don’t shoot</i>, but which I
interpreted to mean <i>shoot</i>, and I let off my rifle. It was a doe.
The whole party were agreed that Count Lev was not to be told.
In the evening I was taken to his office to see him. It was a
little pitch-pine house full of rifles, boots and ledgers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
walking-sticks. He seemed to have about a hundred walking-sticks
and two hundred pairs of boots. He went over the events
of the day. With me was one of the neighbours, who had
also been one of the guns, a Prince Yashville.</p>

<p>Count Lev went through the bag and the number of shots
fired, and just when he was going to ask me if I had fired, Prince
Yashville intervened, and said that I had not had a shot, and I
by my silence gave consent to this statement. The next day
I left for the north, but on the following Sunday, the whole clan
of Bobrinsky family met as usual at tea, and when Count Lev
came in the first thing he said was: “It is an odd thing that
people can’t tell the truth. Mr. Baring said he had not had a
shot out shooting, and one of the barrels of his gun was dirty.”
Then it was explained to him that I had shot at a doe.</p>

<p>I felt I could never go back there again.</p>

<p>Near Smielo there was a village which was almost entirely
inhabited by Jews.</p>

<p>It was from this village, one day, that two Jews came to
Countess Bobrinsky and asked if they might store their furniture
and their books in her stables … they would not
take up much room. When Countess Bobrinsky asked them
why, they said a <i>pogrom</i> had been arranged for the next day.
Countess Bobrinsky was bewildered, and asked them what they
meant, and who was going to make this <i>pogrom</i>. The two
Jews said: <em>They</em> were coming from Kiev by train, and from
another town. The <i>pogrom</i> would take place in the morning
and <em>they</em> would go back in the evening.</p>

<p>When she asked: “Who are <em>they</em>?” she could get no answer,
except that some said it was the Tsar’s orders, some that it
was the Governor’s orders, but <em>they</em> had been sent to make a
<i>pogrom</i>.</p>

<p>Countess Bobrinsky told them to go to the police, but the
Jews said it could not be prevented, and that all had been
arranged for the morrow. Both Count and Countess Bobrinsky
then made inquiries, but all the answer that they could get was
that a <i>pogrom</i> had been arranged for the next day. It was not
the people of the place who would make it; these lived in
peace with the Jews. <em>They</em> would come by the night train
from two neighbouring towns; <em>they</em> would arrive in the morning;
there would be a <i>pogrom</i>, and then <em>they</em> would go away,
and all the next morning carts would arrive from the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
villages, just as when there was a fair, to take away
what was left after the <i>pogrom</i>. When they asked who was
sending the <i>pogrom</i>-makers they could get no answer. Count
Bobrinsky interviewed the local police sergeant, but all he did
was to shrug his shoulders and wring his hands, and ask what
could two policemen do against a multitude? if there was to
be a <i>pogrom</i>, there would be a <i>pogrom</i>. He could do nothing;
nothing could be done; nobody could do anything.</p>

<p>The next morning the peasant cook, a woman, came into
Countess Bobrinsky’s room, and said: “There will be no
<i>pogrom</i> after all. It has been put off.”</p>

<p>I stayed in Russia all that autumn and winter, and I saw
the opening of the third Duma, and arrived in London in the
middle of December. I was no longer correspondent in St.
Petersburg, but I worked in London at journalism, and in the
summer of 1908, together with Hilary Belloc, I edited and
printed a newspaper, which had only one number, called <i>The
North Street Gazette</i>. The newspaper was printed at a press
which we had bought and established in my house, No. 6 North
Street—a picturesque house behind the other houses in North
Street, which possessed a courtyard, a fig-tree, and an underground
passage leading to Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The newspaper was written entirely by Belloc, myself, and
Raymond Asquith, who wrote the correspondence.</p>

<p>It was to be supported by subscribers. We received quite
a number of subscriptions, but we never brought out a second
number, and we returned the cheques to the subscribers.</p>

<p><i>The North Street Gazette</i> had the following epigraph: “Out,
out, brief scandal!” and opened with the following statement of
aims and policy:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">The North Street Gazette</span> is a journal written for
the rich by the poor.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The North Street Gazette</span> will be printed and
published by the proprietors at and from 6 North Street,
Smith Square, Westminster, London, S.W. This, the
first number, appears upon the date which it bears; subsequent
numbers will appear whenever the proprietors
are in possession of sufficient matter, literary and artistic,
or even advertisement, to fill its columns. No price is
attached to the sheet, but a subscription of one guinea
will entitle a subscriber to receive no less than twenty
copies, each differing from the last. These twenty copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
delivered, none will be sent to any subscriber until his next
subscription is paid.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The North Street Gazette</span> will fearlessly expose
all public scandals save those which happen to be lucrative
to the proprietors, or whose exposure might in some way
damage them or their more intimate friends.</p>

<p>“The services of a competent artist have been provisionally
acquired, a staff of prose writers, limited but
efficient, is at the service of the paper; three poets of
fecundity and skill have also been hired. Specimens of
all three classes of work will be discovered in this initial
number.</p>

<p>“A speciality of the newspaper will be that the Russian
correspondence will be written in Russian, and the English
in English.</p>

<p>“All communications (which should be written on one
side of the paper only) will be received with consideration,
and those accompanied by stamps will be confiscated.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then followed a leading article composed entirely of clichés;
a long article advocating votes for monkeys, written by Belloc
and afterwards republished by him; “Society Notes”; a “City
Letter”; and a poem by Belloc, called “East and West,” parts
of which, but not the whole of it, are to be found in his book
<i>The Four Men</i>.</p>

<p>The version I print here is the original form of this spirited
lyric:</p>

<p>Then came a city letter, an account of a debate in the
House of Lords, and some book reviews.</p>

<p>This was the review of <i>Hamlet</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The number of writers who aspire to poetic drama
is becoming legion; Mr. William Shakespeare’s effort—not
his first attempt in that kind—is better in some ways than
some others which we recently noticed. We regret,
therefore, all the more that the dominant motive of his
drama makes it impossible for us to deal with it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shakespeare has taken his subject from the
history of Denmark, and in his play King Claudius is
represented as murdering his brother and marrying Queen
Gertrude, his deceased brother’s wife. There was a King
<i>Claude</i> (whether there has been an intentional change
of name we do not know) who succeeded his brother Olaf II.
We hear a good deal about him, his parentage, and life at
court. That he was intemperate and hasty—he was
known to exceed at meals, and on one occasion he boxed
the Lord Chamberlain’s ears—need hardly be said. But
there is nowhere we can discover a hint of the monstrous
wickedness Mr. Shakespeare has attributed to him. Were
this vile relationship (<i>i.e.</i> the King’s marriage with his
murdered brother’s wife) a fact, it might fairly be a theme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
for the dramatist to deal with; but we repeat we certainly
do not care to criticise the drama in which it is treated.</p>

<p>“We regret this, because we see unmistakable signs
of power in Mr. Shakespeare’s verse. He has a real instinct
for blank verse of the robustious kind, and the true lyric
cry is to be found in the songs of his play, although they
are too often marred by deplorable touches of coarseness.</p>

<p>“He will, we suppose, regard us as fusty old-fashioned
critics for the line we have taken; but, trusting to the
promise which we think we discern in Mr. Shakespeare,
it is by no means unlikely that in ten years’ time he will
be the first to regret his extravagance and to applaud
our disapproval.</p>

<p>“At any rate, although we must speak frankly of such
a plot as <i>Hamlet</i>, we have not the slightest desire wholly
to condemn Mr. Shakespeare as a poet because he has
written a play on an unpleasant theme.</p>

<p>“If he turns his undoubted poetic gifts to what is sane
and manly we shall be the first to welcome him among
the freemasonry of poets. At the same time we should
like to remind him that speeches do not make a play,
and that his dialogue, halting somewhere between what
is readable and what is actable, loses the amplitude of
narrative without achieving the force of drama.”</p>

</div>

<p>The newspaper ended with a sonnet written in the House
of Commons by Belloc, and by a correspondence column
written by Raymond Asquith—both of which items I transcribe.
This correspondence is, I think, the most brilliant of
Raymond Asquith’s ephemera.</p>

<p class="noindent">“To the Editor of <i>The North Street Gazette</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone’s Diction</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—Mr. Tollemache’s letter (in which he shows that
Mr. Gladstone invented the phrase ‘bag and baggage’)
has suggested to me the following reminiscences. I was
the humble means of bringing together Mr. Gladstone and
the late Mr. Cheadle ffrench (at a breakfast-party which
I gave at Frascati’s in 1876). I remember that Mr.
Gladstone turned to me towards the close of the meal, and
remarked in his always impressive manner, ‘We shall hear
more of that young man.’ The prediction was never
fulfilled (though Mr. ffrench was about to become a J.P.
when he died so suddenly two years ago), but the anecdote
is worthy of record as illustrating the origin of another
phrase which has since passed into popular parlance. On
a different occasion I recollect Mr. Gladstone (who was a
good French scholar) employing the (now familiar) expression
‘Dieu et Mon Droit.’ I also had the honour to be
present when Mazzini altered the famous epigram (afterwards
remembered and quoted against him) ‘non vero
ma ben trovato.’ I remember too the pleasure which was
caused by another gentleman present (who shall be nameless)
neatly capping it with the expression ‘Trocadero.’
But those were indeed ‘noctes cenœque deum!’ I recollect
telling this story to Jowett. He replied by asking
me in his curious high voice whether I had read his
translation of Thucydides. I confessed somewhat shamefacedly
that I had not, and I remember that he made no
reply at all (either then or afterwards), but remained
perfectly silent for three days (from Saturday to Monday).
It was characteristic of the man.—Yours, etc.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“COINCIDENCES</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The following may not be without interest
to those of your readers who care for natural history.
Yesterday as I was walking home from the city, I noticed
a large flock of flamingoes (<i>Phœnicopterus ingens</i>) hovering
over Shaftesbury Avenue. This was at 6.17 p.m.
On reaching home I went up to dress to my own room,
which communicates with my wife’s by a stained oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
door. Judge of my surprise to find it tenanted by a
giraffe (<i>Tragelaphus Asiaticus</i>). Surely the coincidence
is a remarkable one.</p>

<p>“The only analogy which occurs to me at this
moment (and that an imperfect one) is a story which
my father used to tell, of how he was one day driving
down Threadneedle Street and observed a middle-aged
man of foreign appearance standing under a lamp-post
and apparently engaged in threading a needle! On inquiry
he discovered that the man’s name was Street!—Yours,
etc.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Foxhunter</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—It is only fair to mention that the man was not
really threading a needle, but, as it afterwards turned
out, playing upon a barrel-organ. My father’s mistake
was due to his defective vision. But this does not affect
the point of the story.</p>

<p>“(Our correspondent’s letter is both frank and
manly; and we shall be interested to know whether
any of our other readers have had similar experiences.)”</p>

<p><i>The North Street Gazette</i> died after its first number, but
it was perhaps the indirect begetter of another newspaper,
that had a longer life, <i>The Eye Witness</i>, which in its turn begat
<i>The New Witness</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Eye Witness</i> was edited at first by Belloc, and then
by Cecil Chesterton. Cecil Chesterton edited <i>The New Witness</i>
until he went as a private soldier to France to fight in the
war and to die. The editorship was then taken over by his
brother Gilbert.</p>

<p>During the next years, until the outbreak of the war, my life
was divided between journalistic work in London and long
sojourns in Russia; while I was in Russia I wrote books on
Russian matters, literary and political. During this period
I went twice to Turkey—once for the <i>Morning Post</i>, to see the
Turkish Revolution in May 1909; and once for the <i>Times</i>, to
try and see something of the Balkan War in 1912. Early in
1912 I went round the world. On three separate occasions
I went for a cruise in a man-of-war. One of these cruises—in
December 1908, when I went as the guest of Commander Fisher
on board the <i>Indomitable</i>—lasted for several weeks, and I was
privileged during this visit to see a sight of thrilling interest—gun-layer’s
test and battle practice in Aranci Bay.</p>

<p>On the eve of Candlemas 1909, I was received into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Catholic Church by Father Sebastian Bowden at the Brompton
Oratory: the only action in my life which I am quite certain
I have never regretted. Father Sebastian began life as an
officer in the Scots Guards. He had served as A.D.C. under
the same chief and at the same time as my uncle, Lord Cromer.
He lived all the rest of his life at the Oratory and died in 1920.
He was fond even in old age of riding about London on a cob.
His face was stamped with the victory of character over all
other elements. He was a sensible Conservative, a patriot, a
fine example of an English gentleman in mind and appearance;
a prince of courtesy, and a saint; and I regard my acquaintance
with him and the friendship and sympathy he gave me
as the greatest privilege bestowed on me by Providence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">CONSTANTINOPLE (1909)</span></h2>

<p>I arrived at Constantinople in May 1909, on the same
day that the Sultan Abdul Hamid left the city. A
revolution had just occurred. The Young Turk party
had dethroned the Sultan. The revolution was a military
one.</p>

<p>When I arrived, the surface life of Constantinople was
unchanged. The only traces of the crisis were a few marks, and
some slight damage done by shells and bullets on the walls
of the houses. The streets were crowded with soldiers. The
tram-cars and the cabs were full of dusty men, stained with the
marks of campaigning: Albanians with rifles slung across their
shoulders, Macedonian gendarmes in light blue uniforms. The
mosques were crowded with soldiers. Shots were sometimes
heard, but none of the soldiery except the marines gave
any trouble.</p>

<p>I lived at the Little Club at Pera. My bedroom looked
out on to the Golden Horn. In the foreground were dark
cypresses. Across the water I could see Stamboul, soft as a
soap-bubble in the haze, milky-white and filmy with a hundred
faint rainbow hues. The Club was a centre of gossip and mild
gambling. Enver Pasha used to frequent it, and one evening
a man called Assiz Bey walked in to play cards, with a piece
of a rope which had just served to hang a man.</p>

<p>I attended the Selamlik of the new Sultan. It was a casual
ceremony. Most of the troops were drawn up in places where
it was impossible for the Sultan to pass, and up to the last
all were in doubt as to what the Sultan’s route would be. At
the last minute the whole cortège was stopped by a large
hay wagon which leisurely took its way along the road which
had been cleared for the Sultan. In Stamboul the brightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
of crowds swarmed—men and women of every colour, dressed
in all colours, chirruping like sparrows, hanging out of
wooden balconies beside broken Byzantine arches, where one
caught sight of trailing wistaria and sometimes of a Judas tree
in blossom. The Sultan had no military escort and only one
<i>sais</i>, dressed in blue and gold, as an outrider. There was no
pomp about the ceremony, which passed off well. The Turkish
Parliament was sitting not a stone’s throw from St. Sophia,
and not far from the site where Justinian’s Palace once stood.
The crowd wandered and lolled about, smoking cigarettes by
the gates of the Parliament; the fickle, opportunist, supple-minded,
picturesque crowd of Stamboul, was, I think, akin to
that which fought for the “Blues” or the “Greens” in the
days of Justinian and Theodora.</p>

<p>One night, I was invited to meet the leading men of the
Young Turk party, Talaat Bey and others. They all drank
water at the meal, but before the meal began, we were all
offered a stiff glass of whisky to show that the new Government
had discarded the old-fashioned Mohammedan principles. But
though the hosts drank the whisky they did not appear to
enjoy it.</p>

<p>The heat at Constantinople, and the atmosphere of the
place, sapped one’s energy. The manifold activities of the
human machine seemed to exhaust themselves in the acts
of drinking coffee and in having one’s boots cleaned. You
had your boots finished off out of doors after they had been
preliminarily cleaned indoors. You sat on a chair and a man
in a shirt and a fez, rubbed them, waxed them, greased them,
kneaded them with his bare hand, brushed them, dusted them,
polished them with a silk handkerchief, and painted the edges
of them with a spirit. And during this process you looked on
at the shifting crowd, sipped your coffee, and thought long
thoughts which led nowhere.</p>

<p>One morning streams of people were walking briskly from
Pera to Stamboul, in the same direction. They were making
for the Galata Bridge, for there was news in the air that they
had been hanging some Turkish Danny Deevers in the morning.
Nobody quite knew whether they had been hanged yet or not.
Some people said they had been hanged at dawn; others, that
they were about to be hanged; others, that they had just
been hanged. They had, as a matter of fact, been hanged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
dawn: three of them at the end of the bridge, three of them
opposite St. Sophia, four, I think, opposite the House of Parliament,
and three somewhere else—making thirteen in all. They
were soldiers, and one of them was an officer. They were
hanged for having taken part in a recent mutiny in the cause
of Abdul Hamid, and for having murdered some men.</p>

<p>As you walked farther along the bridge the crowd grew
denser, and right at the end of the bridge it was a seething mass,
kept back by soldiers from the actual spot where the victims
were hanging—the crowd, not a London-like crowd, all drab
and grey, but a living kaleidoscope of startling colours—the
colours of tulips and Turkey carpets and poppy-fields, red,
blue, and yellow. The gallows, which were in line along the
side of the street beyond the bridge, were primitive tripods of
wood. Each victim was strung up by a rope fixed to a pulley.
The men were hanged by being made to stand on a low chair.
The chair was kicked away and the sharp jerk killed them.
They were hanging not far above the ground. They were each
covered by a white gown, and to the breast of each one his
sentence was affixed, written in Turkish letters. They looked
neither like felons nor like murderers, but rather like happy
martyrs (in a sacred picture), calm, with an inscrutable content.
I had but a glimpse of them, and then I was carried away
by the swaying crowd, which soldiers were prodding with the
butts of their rifles. The dead soldiers were to hang there all
day. I did not go any farther.</p>

<p>As I was trying to make my way back through the crowd, a
Hodja (a Moslem priest) passed, and he was roughly handled
by the soldiers, and given a few sharp blows in the back with
their rifles. I heard fragments of conversation, English and
French. Some people were saying that the exhibition would
have a satisfactory effect on the populace. I saw a Kurd, a
fierce-looking man who was gnashing his teeth—not at the
victims, to be sure, but at the sight of three Moslems who had
died for their faith, and for having defended it against those
who they were told were its enemies, being made into a
spectacle after their death for the unbeliever and the alien.</p>

<p>The following afternoon I was wandering about the streets
of Stamboul when, amongst the indolent crowd, I noticed
several men who were peculiar. Firstly, they were walking
in a hurry. Secondly, they were dressed like Russians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
in long, grey, shabby redingotes, what the Russians call
<i>padevki</i>, and their hair, allowed to grow long, was closely
cropped at the ends just over the neck, where it hung in a
bunch. They wore high boots. I knew they were Russians,
and paid but little attention to them, since Constantinople
is not a place, like London, where the appearance of an
obvious foreigner is a remarkable sight. But I met an English
friend, who said: “Have you seen the Russian pilgrims?”
This led me to run after them. I soon caught them up, for
they were delayed under an arch by some soldiers who were
escorting some prisoners (soldiers also).</p>

<p>“Are you Russian?” I asked one of the pilgrims—a tall,
fair man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered; “I am from Russia.”</p>

<p>“You are a pilgrim?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I come from Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The man was walking in a great hurry, and by this time we
had reached the Galata Bridge.</p>

<p>“Who were those men the soldiers were leading?” the
pilgrim asked me.</p>

<p>“Those were prisoners—soldiers who mutinied.”</p>

<p>Here two others, a grey-bearded man, and a little, dark
man, joined in; the grey-bearded man had a medicine bottle
sticking out of his coat pocket. I am certain it contained an
intoxicating spirit.</p>

<p>“Some soldiers were hanged here,” I added.</p>

<p>“Where?” said the man.</p>

<p>“There,” I answered, showing him the exact spot. “They
stayed there all day.”</p>

<p>“For all the people to see,” said the pilgrim, much impressed.
“Why were they hanged?”</p>

<p>“They mutinied.”</p>

<p>“Ah, just like in our own country!” said the pilgrim.</p>

<p>“But,” joined in the dark man, “have not you sent away
your <i>Gosudar</i>?” (Sovereign).</p>

<p>“I am not from here; I am an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but did the people here send away their <i>Gosudar</i>?”</p>

<p>“They did.”</p>

<p>“And was it done,” asked the grey-haired pilgrim, “with
God favouring and assisting (<i>Po Bozhemu</i>) or not?”</p>

<p>I hesitated. The brown man thought I did not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was it right or wrong?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They said,” I answered, “that their Sultan had not kept
his word; that he had given a ‘Duma’ and was acting against
it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the brown-haired man. “So now they have
a ‘Duma’!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said; “they have liberty now.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Liberty! Eh! Eh! Eh!” said the grey-haired
man, and he chuckled to himself. Oh, the scepticism of that
chuckle!—as much as to say, we know what <i>that</i> means.</p>

<p>“And you have a Sovereign?” asked the brown-haired
man.</p>

<p>“Yes; we have a King.”</p>

<p>“But your Queen, who was so old, and ruled everybody,
she is dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes; she is dead.”</p>

<p>“Ah, she was wise, very wise!” (<i>mudraya</i>).</p>

<p>We had now crossed the bridge. The pilgrims had hastened
on to their steamer, which was alongside the quay. They
were going back to Russia. But one of them lagged behind
and almost bought a suit of clothes. I say almost, because it
happened like this: A clothes-seller—Greek, or Armenian, or
Heaven knows what!—was carrying a large heap of clothes:
striped trousers, black waistcoats, and blue serge coats. The
brown pilgrim chose a suit. The seller asked five roubles. The
pilgrim offered three. All the steps of the bargain were gone
through at an incredible speed, because the pilgrim was in a
great hurry. The seller asked him among other things if he
would like my blue serge jacket. The pilgrim said certainly
not; it was not good enough. Finally, after looking at all the
clothes and trying on one coat, which was two sizes too small,
he made his choice and offered three roubles and a half. The
bargain was just going to be closed when the pilgrim suddenly
said the stuff was bad and went away as fast as he could, bidding
me good-bye. He was a native of Voronezh.</p>

<p>After a short spell of cold weather the spring came back once
more and opened “her young adventurous arms” to greet the
day of the “Coronation” of the new Sultan. There was that
peculiar mixture of warmth and freshness in the air, that intoxicating
sweetness, which you only get in the South; and
after a recent rainfall the green foliage in which the red-tiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
houses of the city are embedded, like red bricks in moss,
gleamed with a new freshness. The streets were early crowded
with people eager to make their way towards Eyoub, to the
mosque where the Sultan is invested with the Sword of Osman.</p>

<p>I drove with Aubrey Herbert across the old bridge
into the straggling Jewish quarter on the other side of the
Golden Horn. The houses there are square and wooden,
rickety and crooked, top-heavy, bending over the narrow street
as though they were going to fall down, squalid, dirty, dusty,
and rotten; they are old, and sometimes you come across a
stone house with half-obliterated remains of beautiful Byzantine
window arches and designs. Every now and then you got
glimpses of side streets as steep as Devonshire lanes and as
narrow as London slums, with wistaria in flower trailing across
the street from roof to roof. All along the road people were at
their doorsteps, and people and carriages were moving in the
direction of Eyoub. After a time, progress, which up to then
had been easy and rapid, came to a dead stop, and the coachman
who was driving Herbert and myself dived into a side lane and
began driving in the opposite direction, back, as it seemed,
towards Constantinople. Then he all at once took a turning
to the right, and we began to climb a steep and stony track
until we reached the walls of Constantinople. These walls,
which were built, I believe, by the Emperor Theodosius, are
enormously thick and broad. As we reached them, people
were climbing up on to the top of them.</p>

<p>Soon we came to a crowd, which was being kept back
by soldiers, and the intervention of an officer was necessary
to let us drive through the Adrianople Gate into the road
along which the Sultan was to pass on his way back to Constantinople
after the ceremony. We drove through the gate,
right on to the route of the procession, which was stony, rough,
and steep. We were at the top of a high hill. To the right of
us were the huge broad walls, as thick as the towers of our
English castles, grassy on the top, and dotted with a thick
crowd of men dressed in colours as bright as the plumage of
tropical birds. At this moment, as I write, the colour of one
woman’s dress flashes before me—a brilliant cerulean, bright
as the back of a kingfisher, gleaming in the sun like a jewel.
To the left was a vista of trees, delicate spring foliage, cypresses,
mosques, green slopes, and blue hills. Both sides of the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
were lined with a many-coloured crowd—some sitting on chairs,
some in tents, some on primitive wooden stands. Lines of
soldiers kept the people back. The road itself was narrow.
It was a crowd of poor people, but it was none the less
picturesque on that account. Vendors of lemonade and water-carriers
walked up and down in front of the people. Some
of the spectators hung small carpets from their seats. The
tents varied in size and quality, some boasting of magnificent
embroideries and others were such as gipsies pitch near a
race-course. We drove on and on through this double line
of coloured people and troops, down the narrow cobbled way,
until we reached the level, and there, after a time, we were
obliged to leave the carriage and go on foot.</p>

<p>The makeshift stands, the extemporary decorations, the
untidy crowd, proved that in the East no elaboration and no
complicated arrangements are necessary to make a pageant.
Nature and the people provide colours more gorgeous than
any wealth of panoplies, banners, and gems could display, and
the people seem to be part of nature herself and to share her
brightness.</p>

<p>We walked through a cordon of cavalry until we reached
the mosque of Eyoub. The Sultan had already arrived and his
carriage was waiting at the gate. The carriages of other dignitaries
were standing in a side street. A small street of wooden
houses led up to the mosque. We were beckoned to the
ground floor of one of these houses by a brown personage in a
yellow turban. We were shown on to a small platform divided
into two tiers, crowded with Turkish men and women; others
were standing on the floor. Some of the spectators were
officers; some wore uniform; among those on the lower tier
were some soldiers, a policeman, and a postman. We were
welcomed with great courtesy and given seats. But whenever
we asked questions, every question—no matter what it was
about—was taken to mean that we were anxious to know when
the Sultan was coming. And to every question the same
answer was made gently by these kind and courteous people,
as though they were dealing with children: “Have patience,
my lamb, the Sultan will soon be here.”</p>

<p>Immediately in front of us stood the large French barouche
of the Sultan, drawn by four bay horses, the carriage glittering
with gilding and lined with satin. We waited about an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
the people every now and then continuing to reassure us that
the Sultan would soon be there. Then we heard the band.
Two men spread a small carpet on the steps of the carriage, into
which the Sultan immediately stepped, and drove off, headed
by a <i>sais</i> dressed in blue and gold and mounted on a bay horse.</p>

<p>As this large gilded barouche passed, with the Sultan in
uniform inside it, the spirit of the Second Empire seemed for
one moment to hover in the air, and I half expected the band
to play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Voici le sabre, le sabre, le sabre,</div>
<div class="verse">Voici le sabre, le sabre de mon père,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which, as far as the words go, would have been appropriate,
as the Sultan had just been girded with the sword of his
predecessors. This sudden ghost of the Second Empire contrasted
sharply with the spectators with whom I was standing.
They belonged to the Arabian Nights, to infinitely old and
far-off things, like the Old Testament. They became solemn
when the Sultan passed, and murmured words of blessing.
But there was no outward show of enthusiasm and no cheering
nor even clapping.</p>

<p>I wondered whether the ghost of the Second Empire, which
had seemed to be present, were an omen or not, and whether
the ceremony which marked the inauguration, not only of a
new reign but also of a new régime—a totally different order of
things, a fresh era and epoch—were destined to see its hope
fulfilled, or whether under the gaiety and careless lightness
it was in reality something terribly solemn and fatal of quite
another kind, namely, the funeral procession of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my stay I was taken by the British
Ambassador and Lady Lowther in their yacht to Brusa, where
we spent three nights. Brusa in spring is one of the most lovely
places in the world. It is nested high on a hill, which you
reach after a long drive from the coast, and before you towers
Mount Olympus. Brusa is a place of roses and streams and
elegant mosques, and baths built of seaweed-coloured marbles.
The cool rivulets flow down the hill like the little streams
described by Dante:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Li ruscelletti che de’ verdi colli</div>
<div class="verse">Del Casentin discendon giuso in Arno,</div>
<div class="verse">Facendo i lor canali e freddi e molli,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The water of the springs and streams at Brusa seemed to have
a secret freshness of their own. The roses were in full bloom;
nightingales sang all day; and the cool sound of running water
was always in one’s ears.</p>

<p>I left Constantinople in the middle of June, convinced of
one thing, that the new Turkish régime was not unlike the
old one, and that what a man who had lived for years in Constantinople
had told me was true. When I had mentioned the
Young Turks to him, he said: “Qui sont les jeunes Turcs?
Il n’y a que les Turcs.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BALKAN WAR, 1912</span></h2>

<p>“On arrive novice à toutes les guerres,” wrote the French
philosopher; or if he did not, he said something
like it. I have never known a place where being
on the spot made so sharp a difference in one’s point of
view as the Near East, and where one’s ignorance, and the
ignorance of the great mass of one’s fellow-countrymen, was so
keenly brought home to one. The change in the point of view
happened with surprising abruptness the moment one crossed
the Austrian frontier. There are other changes of a physical
nature which happen as well when one crosses the frontier
into any kingdom where war is taking place. The whole of
the superficial luxuries of civilisation seem to disappear in a
twinkling; and so adaptable a creature is man that you feel
no surprise; you just accept everything as if things had always
been so. The trains crawl; they stop at every station; you
no longer complain of the inadequacy of the luxuries of your
sleeping-car; you are thankful to have a seat at all. It is no
longer a question of criticising the quality of the dinner or the
swiftness of the service. It is a question whether you will get
a piece of bread or a glass of water during the next twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Belgrade Station was full of reservists and peasants: men
in uniform, men half in uniform, men in the clothes of the
mountains—sheepskin coats, putties, and shoes made of twisted
straw; dark, swarthy, sunburnt and wind-tanned, hard men,
carrying rifles and a quantity of bundles and filling the cattle
vans to overflowing. At every station we passed trains, most
of them empty, which were coming back to fetch supplies of
meat. Every platform and every station were crowded with
men in uniforms of every description. A Servian officer got
into the carriage in which I was travelling. He was dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
khaki. He wore a white chrysanthemum in his cap, a bunch
of Michaelmas daisies in his belt, and he carried, besides his
rifle and a khaki bag which had been taken from the Turks, a
small umbrella. He had been wounded in the foot at Kumanovo.
He was on his way to Uskub. He was a man of commerce,
and had closed his establishment to go to the war; the majority
of the officers in his regiment were men of commerce, he
said. They had sacrificed everything to go to the war, and
that was one reason why they were not going to allow the
gains of the war, which they declared were a matter of life
and death to their country, to be snatched from them by
diplomatists at a green table. “If they want to take from
us what we have won by the sword,” he said, “let them take
it by the sword.”</p>

<p>I asked him about the fighting at Kumanovo. He said the
Turks had fought like heroes, but that they were miserably
led. He then began to describe the horrors of the war in the
Servian language. As I understood about one word in fifty,
I lost the thread of the discourse, and so I lured him back into
a more neutral language. He told me that someone had asked
a Turkish prisoner how it came about that the Turks, whom all
the world knew to be such brave soldiers, were nevertheless
always beaten. The Turk, after the habit of his race, answered
by an apologue as follows: “A certain man,” he said, “once
possessed a number of camels and an ass. He was a hard
taskmaster to the camels, and he worked them to the uttermost;
and after trading for many years in different lands, he became
exceedingly rich. At last one day he himself fell sick; and
feeling that his end was drawing nigh, he wished to relieve
himself of the burden on his soul, so he bade the camels
draw near to him, and he addressed them thus: ‘I am dying,
camels, dying, only I have most uncivilly kept death waiting,
until I have unburdened my soul to you. Camels, I have done
you a grievous wrong. When you were hungry, I stinted you
of food, when you were thirsty, I denied you drink, and
when you were weary, I urged you on and denied you rest;
and ever and always I denied you the full share of your fair
and just wage. Now I am dying, and all this lies heavily
on my soul, I crave your forgiveness, so that I may die in
peace. Can you forgive me, camels, for all the wrong I have
done you?’ The camels withdrew to talk it over. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
a while the Head Camel returned and spoke to the merchant
thus: ‘That you ever overworked us, we forgive you; that
you underfed us, we forgive you; that you never remembered
to pay us our full wage, we forgive you; but that you always
let the ass go first, Allah may forgive you, but we never can!’”</p>

<p>It took over twelve hours to get from Belgrade to the
junction of Nish, where there was a prospect of food. When
we stopped at one station in the twilight there was a great
noise of cheering from another train, and a dense crowd of
soldiers and women throwing flowers. Then in the midst of
the clamour and the murmur somebody played a tune on a
pipe. A little Slav tune written in a scale which has a
technical name—let us say the Phrygian mode—a plaintive,
piping tune, as melancholy as the cry of a seabird. The
very voice of exile. I recognised the tune at once. It is
in the first ten pages of Balakirev’s collection of Russian folk-songs
under the name “Rekrutskaya”—that is to say, recruits’
song. Plaintive, melancholy, quaint, and piping, it has no
heartache in it; it is the luxury of grief, the expression of idle
tears, the conventional sorrow of the recruit who is leaving
his home.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">And there’s no one left to love me now, and you will soon forget.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>So, in the song of our grandfathers which I have quoted
earlier in the book, the maiden sang to the conscript, adding
that were she King of France, “or, still better, Pope of
Rome,” she would abolish war, and consequently the parting
of lovers. But the song of the Slav recruit in its piping notes
seems to say: “I am going far away, but I am not really
sorry to go. They will be glad to get rid of me at home, and
I, in the barracks, shall have meat to eat twice a day, and jolly
comrades, and I shall see the big town and find a new love as
good as my true love. They will mend my broken heart there;
but in the meantime let me make the most of the situation.
Let me collect money and get drunk, and let me sing my sad
songs, songs of parting and exile, and let me enjoy the melancholy
situation to the full.”</p>

<p>That is what the wistful, piping song, played on a wooden
flageolet of some kind, seemed to say. It just pierced through
the noise and then stopped; a touching interlude, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
shepherd’s piping amidst the weariness, the fever and the fret,
the delirious remembrance and the agonised expectation, of
the last act of Wagner’s <i>Tristan und Isolda</i>. The train moved
on into the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>We arrived at Nish at eight o’clock in the evening. It
was dark; the station was sparsely lighted; the buffet, to
which we had been looking forward all day, was as crowded as
a sardine-box and apparently devoid of anything suggesting
food. Wounded soldiers, reservists, officers filled the waiting-room
and the platform. The Servian officer dived into the
crowd and returned presently, bringing his sheaves with him
in the shape of three plates of hot chicken.</p>

<p>Nish seemed an unfit-like meeting-place for triumphant
soldiers; it resembled rather the scene of a conspiracy in
a melodrama, where tired conspirators were plotting nothing
at all. One felt cut off from all news. In London, one
knew, in every sitting-room people were marking off the movements
of the battles with paper flags on inaccurate maps.
Here at Nish, in the middle of a crowd of men who either had
fought or were going to fight, one knew less about the war than
in Fleet Street. One bought a newspaper, but it dealt with
everything except war news.</p>

<p>A man came into the refreshment-room—the name was in
this case ironical—and said, “I have had nothing to eat, not a
piece of bread and not a drop of water, for twenty-four hours,”
and then, before anybody could suggest a remedy—for food
there was none—he went away. Afterwards I saw him with
a chicken in his hand. One man was carrying a small live
pig, which squealed. In the corner of the platform two men,
with crutches and bandages, dressed in the clothes of the
country, were sitting down, looking as if they were tired of
life. I offered them a piece of cold sausage, which they
were too tired to accept; only at the sight of a cigarette one of
them made a gesture, and, being given one, smoked and smoked
and smoked. I knew the feeling. Suddenly, in the darkness, a
sleeping-car appeared, to the intense surprise of everyone—an
International sleeping-car, with sheets, and plenty of room in
it. My travelling companion and myself started for Sofia,
where we arrived the next morning.</p>

<p>At Sofia the scene on the platform was different. The place
was full of bustle; the platform crowded with Red Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
men, nurses, and soldiers, in tidy, practical uniforms. The
refreshment-room, too, was crowded with doctors. You heard
fragments of many languages: the scene might have been
Mukden, 1904, or, indeed, any railway station in any war anywhere.
An exceedingly capable porter got me my luggage
with dispatch, and I drove to the hotel in a “phaeton,” but
not with the coursers of the sun. The horses here had all gone
to the war. At the hotel I was first given—the only room said
to be vacant—a room which was an annex to the café. For
furniture it had six old card-tables and nothing else.</p>

<p>Full of Manchurian memories, I was about to think this
luxurious, when the offending Adam in me quite suddenly
revolted, and I demanded and obtained instead a luxurious
upper chamber. I stayed about a week at Sofia, and made
unavailing efforts to get to the front. I was then told I
would find it easier to get to the front where the Servian
Army was fighting. So, laden with papers and passports, I
started for Uskub.</p>

<p>I travelled from Sofia to Nish in the still existing comfortable
sleeping-cars; but when I arrived once more at the junction
of Nish I learnt a lesson which I thought I had mastered many
years ago, and that is, take in a war as much luggage as you
possibly can to your civilised base, but once you start for the
front or anywhere near it, take nothing at all except a tea-basket
and a small bottle of brandy. I had only a small trunk
with me, but the stationmaster refused to let it proceed. War
goes to the heads of stationmasters like wine. This particular
stationmaster had no right whatsoever to stop my small trunk
on the grounds that it was full of contraband goods, and he
could perfectly well have had it examined then and there;
instead of which he said it would have to be taken to the Custom
House Office in the town, which would involve a journey of two
hours and the missing of my train. I was obliged to leave my
trunk at the station, nor cast one longing, lingering look behind.
The only reason I mention this episode, which has no sort of
interest in itself, is to illustrate something which I will come to
later. At Nish I got into a slow train. The railway carriage
was full of people. There was in it a Servian poet, who had
temporarily exchanged the lyre for the lancet, and enrolled
himself in the Medical Service. His name was Dr. Milan Curçin—pronounced
Churchin. He showed me the utmost kindness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Like all modern poets, he was intensely practical, and an admirable
man of business, and he promised to get me back my trunk
and either to bring it to Uskub himself, as he was continually
travelling backwards and forwards between Uskub and Nish,
or to have it sent wherever I wished. He spoke several
languages, and we discussed the war. He said the Servians
resented the abuse which had been levelled against them by
Pierre Loti. Pierre Loti, he said, accused them of being
barbarians and of attacking Turkey without reason.</p>

<p>“We,” said the poet, “hate war as much as anyone.
What does Pierre Loti know of our history? What does
he know of Turkish rule in Servia? He knows Stamboul;
‘but what does he know of Turkey who only Stamboul
knows?’ Besides, if Pierre Loti’s knowledge of Turkey was
anything like his knowledge of Japan, as reflected in that
pretty book called <i>Madame Chrysanthème</i>—a book which
made all serious scholars of Japan rabid with rage—it is
not worth much.” He had no wish to deny the Turks
their qualities. That was not the point. The point was
Turkish rule in Servia in the past, and that was unspeakable.
The poet was obliged to get out at the first station we
stopped at, and after his departure I moved into another compartment,
in which there were a wounded soldier, a young
Russian volunteer, who was studying at the Military Academy
at Moscow, two men of business who were now soldiers, and a
gendarme who had been standing up all night, and who stood
up all day. I offered these people some tea, having a tea-basket
with me. They accepted it gratefully, and after a little
time one of them asked me if I were an Austrian. I said no;
I was an Englishman. They said: “We thought it extremely
odd that an Austrian should offer us tea.” The wounded
soldier, thinking I was a doctor, asked me if I could do anything
to his wound. As he spoke Servian I could only understand
a little of what he said. It seemed heart-breaking, just
as one began to get on more or less in Bulgarian, to have to
shift one’s language to one which, although the same in essentials,
is superficially utterly different in accent, intonation, and in
most of the common words of everyday life! Servian and
Bulgarian are the same language at root, but Servian is more
like Polish, Bulgarian more like Russian. Servian is a great
literary language, with a mass of poetry and a beautiful store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of folk songs and folk epics. Bulgarian compared with it is
more or less of a patois; it is like Russian with all the inflections
left out. With the help of the Russian student I gathered that
the soldier had been wounded at the battle of Kumanovo,
that his wound had been dressed and bandaged by a doctor,
but that subsequently he had gone to a wise woman, who had
put some balm on it, and that the effect of the balm had
been disastrous. I strongly recommended him to consult
a doctor on the first possible occasion. It is travelling under
such circumstances, in war-time especially, that one really gets
beneath the crust of a country. Every man who travels in
an International sleeping-car becomes more or less international;
and it is not in hotels or embassies that you get face
to face with a people, however excellent your recommendations.
But travel third-class in a full railway carriage, in times of war,
and you get to the heart of the country through which you are
travelling. The qualities of the people are stripped naked—their
good qualities and their bad qualities; and this is why I
mentioned the episode of the trunk, in order to call attention
to the extreme kindness shown to me by the Servian poet, Dr.
Curçin, who rescued the trunk for me at great personal inconvenience.
I hoped that the “Georgian” poets would do the
same for a Servian war correspondent, supposing there were
a war in England and they were to come across one.</p>

<p>After many hours we came to a stop where it was necessary
to change, at Vranja; and then began one of those long war
waits which are so exasperating. The station was full to overflowing
with troops; there was no room to sit down in the
waiting-room. We waited there for two hours, and then, at
last, the train was formed which was bound for Uskub. There
were several members of the Servian Parliament who had
reserved places in this train, and in a moment, it appeared to
be quite full, and there seemed to be no chance of getting a
place in it. I was handicapped also by carrying a saddle and
a bridle, which blocked up the narrow corridor of the railway
carriage. But I got a place in the train, and room was found
for the saddle owing to the kindness of an aviator called
Alexander Maritch. He was one of those extremely unselfish
people who seem to spend their life in doing nothing but
extremely tiresome things for other people. He carried my
saddle in his hands for half an hour, and at last managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
find room for it where it would not be in the way of all the
other passengers. He was an astonishingly capable man with
his hands and his fingers. There appeared to be nothing he
could not do. He uncoupled the railway carriages; he mended
during the journey a quantity of broken objects, and he spent
the whole of the time in making himself useful in one way or
another.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall we arrived at the station of Kumanovo,
and got out to have a look at the battlefield. It was quite
dark and the ground was covered with snow. Drawn up near
the station were a lot of guns and ammunition carts which
had been taken from the Turks. Here were some Maxim guns
whose screens were perforated by balls, which shows that they
could not have been made of good material; and indeed
at Uskub I was told that there were no doubt cases where
the Turkish material was bad; but another and more potent
cause of the disorganisation in the Turkish Army was the
manner in which the Turks handled, or rather mishandled,
their weapons. They forgot to unscrew the shells; they jammed
the rifles. This is not surprising to anyone who has ever seen
a Turk handle an umbrella. He carries it straight in front of
him, pointing towards him in the air, if it is shut, and sideways
and beyond his head, if it is open.</p>

<p>We arrived at Uskub about half-past eight. The snow
was thawing. The aspect was desolate. The aviator found me
a room in the Hôtel de la Liberté; but the window in it was
broken, and there was no fuel. It was as damp as a vault.
We had dinner. I happened to mention that it would be nice
to smoke a cigarette, but I had not got any more. At once the
aviator darted out of the room and disappeared. “He won’t
come back,” said one of his friends, “till he has found you some
cigarettes, you may be sure of that.” In an hour’s time he
returned with three cigarettes, having scoured the town for
them, the shops, of course, being shut.</p>

<p>Uskub is a picturesque, straggling place, and at that time
of the year, swamped as it was in melting snow, an incredibly
dirty place, situated between a mountain and the river Vardar.
Like all Turkish towns, it is ill-paved, or rather not paved at
all, and full of mud. It is—or was—largely inhabited by
Albanian Mohammedans. As the headquarters of the Servian
Army, it was full of officers and soldiers; there was not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
food, and still less wood. Here were the war correspondents.
They had not been allowed to go any farther; but the order
went out that they could, if they liked, go on to Kuprulu, a
little farther down the line, whence it was impossible to telegraph.
A stay at Uskub, as it was then, would afford a tourist
a taste of all the discomforts of war without any of its excitement.
The principal distraction of the people at Uskub was
having their boots cleaned; and as the streets were full of
large lakes of water and high mounds of slush, the effect of the
cleaning was not permanent. Matthew Arnold was once asked
to walk home after dinner on a wet night in London. “No,”
he said; “I can’t get my feet wet. It would spoil my style.”
Matthew Arnold’s style would have been annihilated at Uskub.</p>

<p>The stories told by eye-witnesses of the events immediately
preceding the occupation of Uskub by the Serbians were tragicomic
in a high degree. In the first place, the population of
the place never for one moment thought that the Turks could
possibly be beaten by the Servians. Suddenly, in the midst
of their serene confidence, came the cry: “The Giaours are
upon us.” Every Turkish official and officer in the place lost
his head, with the exception of the Vali (head of the district),
who was the only man possessing an active mind. Otherwise
the Turkish officers fled to the Consulates and took refuge
there, trembling and quaking with terror.</p>

<p>The two problems which called for immediate solution were:
(<i>a</i>) to prevent further fighting taking place in the town; (<i>b</i>)
to prevent a general massacre of the Christians before the
Servians entered the town. To prevent fighting in the town,
the Turkish troops had to be persuaded to get out of it. This
was done. The only hope of solving both these problems lay
in the Vali. All the Consuls, as I said, agreed that the Vali’s
conduct on this occasion shone amidst the encircling cowardice
of the other officers and officials. Already before the news of the
battle of Kumanovo had reached the town about two hundred
Christians had been arrested on suspicion and put in prison. They
were not of the criminal class, but just ordinary people—priests,
shopmen, and women. About three hundred Mohammedans
were already in the prison. News came to the Russian Consul-General,
M. Kalnikoff, that these prisoners had had nothing to
eat for two days. He went at once to the prison and demanded
to be let in. He heard shots being fired inside. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Albanians were firing into the air. He asked the Governor of
the prison whether it was true that the prisoners had had no
food for two days, and the Governor said it was perfectly true,
and that the reason was that there was no bread to be had in
the town.</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the Consul-General, “you must let
all these prisoners out.”</p>

<p>“But if I let them out,” said the Governor, “the Mohammedans
will kill the Christians.”</p>

<p>Finally it was settled that the prisoners should be let out
a few at a time, the Christians first, and the Mohammedans
afterwards, through a hedge of soldiers; and this was accomplished
successfully. M. Kalnikoff told me that among the
prisoners were many people he knew.</p>

<p>Then came the question of giving up the town to the Servians
without incurring a massacre. I am not certain of the chronology
of the events, and all this was told me in one hurried and
interrupted interview, but the Vali took the matter in hand,
and as he was driving to the Russian Consulate a man in the
crowd shot him through the arm and killed the coachman.
This man was said to be mad.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the various Consulates were crowded with
refugees, and in the French Consulate a Turkish officer fainted
from apprehension, and another officer insisted on disguising
himself as a <i>kavass</i>. The Servians, who were outside the city,
at some considerable distance, thought that the Turks meant
to offer further resistance in the town.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the various Consuls and the Vali (in
their uniforms) should set out for the Servian headquarters and
deliver up the town. This was done. They drove out until
they met Servian troops. Then they were blindfolded and
marched between a cordon of soldiers through the deep mud
until they reached those in authority. They explained matters,
and the Servian cavalry rode into the town, just in time to
prevent a massacre of the Christian population. As it was,
the Albanians had already done a good deal of looting. That
there was no fighting in the town, and consequently no massacre,
was probably due to the prompt action of the Vali.</p>

<p>When the Turkish and Albanian soldiers retired south from
Kumanovo they were apparently completely panic-stricken.
At Uskub, horses belonging to batteries were put in trains, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the guns were left behind. There is not the slightest doubt that
the troops massacred any Christians they came across. At the
military hospital at Nish I saw a woman who was terribly cut
and mutilated. She told the following story: Her house, in
which were her husband, her brother, his son-in-law, and her
two sons, was suddenly occupied by Arnaut refugees. These
were Albanians from the north, who were fighting with the
Turks. The Arnauts demanded weapons, which they were
given. They then set fire to the house, killed the woman’s
husband and everyone else who was there, and no doubt thought
that they had killed her also. But she was found still breathing,
and taken to the hospital. The doctor said that she might
recover. Stories such as these, and far worse, one heard on all
sides. The Arnauts were an absolutely uncompromising people.
They gave and expected no quarter. In the hospitals they
bit the doctors who tried to help them. They fought and struck
as long as there was a breath left in their bodies.</p>

<p>At the military hospital of Nish I saw many of the
wounded. The wounds inflicted by bullets were clean, and
the doctors said that they were such that the wounded either
recovered and were up and about in a week, or else they died.
There were cases of tetanus, and I saw many men who had
received severe bayonet wounds and fractures at the battle of
Perlepe, where some of the severest fighting had taken place.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this battle somebody on the Servian
side must have blundered. A regiment was advancing, expecting
to meet reinforcements on both sides. In front of them, on
a hill, they saw what they took to be their own men, and halted.
Immediately a hot fire rained on them from all sides. The
men they had seen were not their own men but Turks. The
Servians had to get away as fast as ever they could go, otherwise
they would have been surrounded; as it was, they incurred
severe losses.</p>

<p>You had only to be a day in Servia to realise the spirit of the
people. They were full of a concentrated fire of patriotism.
The war to them was a matter of life and death. They
regarded their access to the sea as a question of life and death
to their country. They had been the driving power in the war.
They had had to make the greater sacrifices; and the part
they had played certainly was neither realised nor appreciated.
The Servians were less reserved than the Bulgarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
but they had the same singleness of purpose and the same
power of cleaving fast to one great idea.</p>

<p>I only spent four or five days at Uskub, and as there seemed
to be no chance of getting within range of any fighting, I
went back to Sofia. I stopped on the way to Nish, where I
visited the military hospital, and there I met once more the
Servian poet, and received my lost trunk from his hands. Just
outside the Servian hospital there was a small church. This
church was originally a monument built by the Turks to
celebrate the taking of Nish, and its architecture was designed
to discourage the Servians from ever rising against them
again, for the walls were made almost entirely of the skulls
of massacred Servians.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CONSTANTINOPLE ONCE MORE (1912)</span></h2>

<p>As soon as I got back to Sofia I found that there would be
nothing of interest for me to do or see there, and no
chance of getting to the Bulgarian front. I might
perhaps have got to Headquarters, but that would have been
of little use, and the <i>Times</i>, for whom I was writing, already
had one correspondent with the Bulgarian army. So I settled
to go to Constantinople <i>via</i> Bucharest.</p>

<p>I spent a night at Bucharest, and I arrived at Constantinople
on a drizzly, damp, autumn day in November.</p>

<p>Many people have recorded the melancholy they have
felt on arriving at Constantinople for the first time, especially
in the autumn, under a grey sky, when the kaleidoscopic,
opalescent city loses its radiance, suffers eclipse, and seems
to wallow in greyness, sadness, dirt, and squalor. A man
arriving at Constantinople on November 19, 1912 would have
received this melancholy impression at its very intensest. The
skies were grey, the air was damp, and the streets looked
more than usually squalid and dishevelled. But in addition to
this, there was in the air a feeling of great gloom, which was
intensified by the chattering crowds in Pera, laughing and
making fun of the Turkish reverses, by the chirping women at
the balconies, watching the stragglers and the wounded coming
back from the front, and listening, in case they might hear the
enemy sullenly firing. In the city you felt that every Turk,
sublimely resigned as ever, and superficially, at least, utterly
expressionless and indifferent as usual, was walking about with
a heavy heart, and probably every thinking Turk was feeling
bitterly that the disasters which had come were due to the
criminal folly of a band of alien and childishly incompetent
political quacks. You felt also above everything else the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
invincible atmosphere of Byzantium, which sooner or later
conquers and disintegrates its conquerors, however robust
and however virile. Byzantium, having disintegrated two great
Empires, seemed to be ironically waiting for a new prey. One
remembered Bismarck’s saying that he could wish no greater
misfortune to a country than the possession of Constantinople.</p>

<p>But so quick are the changes there, so chameleon-like is the
place, that all this was already out of date two days later. In
three days the mood of the city completely changed: people
began to talk of the enemy being driven right back to Sofia;
the feast of Bairam was celebrated; the streets were decked
with flags; the men-of-war were dressed; and, in the soft
autumnal sunshine, the city glowed once more in its ethereal
coat of many colours.</p>

<p>The stories of the cholera, people said, had been grossly
exaggerated; 8000 Bulgarians had been taken prisoners (800
was the subsequent figure, some people said three, some
people said one). Cholera was raging in the enemy’s lines. New
troops were pouring in. The main enemy would be repulsed;
the others would be dealt with piecemeal, “as before”; in
fact, everything was said to be going well.</p>

<p>But I saw a thing with my eyes, which threw some light
on the conditions under which the war was being carried on.
One morning I drove out in a motor-car with two companions
and a Turkish officer, with the intention of reaching the Tchataldja
lines. Until that day people had been able to reach the
lines in motor-cars. Probably too many people had done this;
and most properly an order had been issued to put a stop to the
flood of visitors. In spite of the presence of a Turkish officer
with us we could not get beyond the village of Kutchuk Tchekmedche,
which is right on the Sea of Marmora. Not far from
the village, and separated from it by a small river, is a railway
station, and as we drove past the bank of the railway line we
noticed several dead men lying on the bank. The station was
being disinfected. We stopped by the sandy beach to have
luncheon, and before we had finished a cart passed us with more
dead in it. We drove back through San Stefano. We entered
through a gate and drove down the suburb, where, bounded on
one side by a railway embankment, and on the other hand by a
wall, there was a large empty space intersected by the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Beyond this were the houses of San Stefano. It was in this
space that we were met by the most gruesome and terrible sight
I have ever seen; worse than any battlefield or the sight of
wounded men. This plot of ground was littered with dead and
dying men. The ground itself was strewn with rags, rubbish,
and filth of every kind, and everywhere, under the wall, on the
grass, by the edge of the road, and on the road, were men in
every phase and stage of cholera.</p>

<p>There was nobody to help them; nobody to look after them;
nothing to be done for them. Many of them were dead, and
lay like terrible black waxworks in contorted shapes. Others
were moving and struggling, and others again were just gasping
out the last flicker of life. One man was making a last effort to
grasp a gourd. And in the middle of this there were other
soldiers, sitting patiently waiting and eating bread under the
walls of the houses. There was not a sound, not a murmur.
Imagine a crowd of holiday-makers at Hampstead Heath
suddenly stricken by plague, and you will have some idea of
this terrible sight. Imagine one of Gustave Doré’s illustrations
to Dante’s “Inferno” made into a <i>tableau vivant</i> by some
unscrupulous and decadent artist. Imagine the woodcuts in
old Bibles of the Children of Israel stricken in the desert and
uplifting their helpless hands to the Brazen Serpent. Deserted,
helpless, and hopeless, this mass of men lay like a heap of half-crushed
worms, to suffer and to die amidst indescribable filth,
and this only seven miles from the capital, where the nurses
were not allowed to get patients! Soon after I saw this grisly
sight I met Mr. Philip, First Secretary of the U.S.A. Embassy,
at the Club. He told me he had been to San Stefano, and that
he and a U.S.A. doctor, Major Ford, were trying to do something
to relieve the people who were suffering from cholera. Would
I come and help them?</p>

<p>The next day I went to San Stefano.</p>

<p>San Stefano is a small suburb of Constantinople whose
name, as we all know, has been written in history. Possibly
some day Clapham Junction will be equally famous if there is
ever a Treaty of Clapham, subsequently ratified by the Powers
at a Congress of Constantinople or Delhi. It contains a number
of elegant whitewashed and two-storied houses, inhabited by
the well-to-do of Constantinople during the summer months.
San Stefano—why or how I know not—became during the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
one of the smaller centres of the sick—in other words, a cholera
camp.</p>

<p>San Stefano, at the time of my visit, was entirely deserted;
the elegant summer “residences” empty. The streets were
silent. You could reach San Stefano from Constantinople
either by steamer, which took a little over an hour and a half;
or by train, which took an hour (but there were practically no
trains running); or in a carriage, which took two hours and
a half. The whole place was lifeless. Only on the quay,
porters and Red Crescent orderlies dealt with great bales of
baggage, and every now and then in the silent street you heard
the tinkling, stale music of a faded pianoforte which played an
old-fashioned—not an old—tune. I wondered, when I heard
this music, who in the world could be playing the pianoforte in
San Stefano at such a moment. I need hardly say that the
effect was not only melancholy but uncanny; for what is
there sadder in the world than out-of-date music played on
an exhausted and wheezy instrument?</p>

<p>At the quay a line of houses fronted the sea. You then
turned up a muddy side street and you came to a small square,
where there were a few shops and a few cafés. In the cafés,
which were owned by Greeks, people were drinking coffee.
The shops were trading in articles which they have brought from
the bazaars and which they thought might be of use to the
cholera patients. A little farther on, beyond the muddy square,
where a quantity of horses, donkeys, and mules were tethered
to the leafless trees, you came to a slight eminence surrounded
by walls and railings. Within these walls there was a small
building made of stucco, Grecian in style. It was the deserted
Greek school. This is the place where cholera patients at last
found shelter, and this is the place which I was brought to
by Major Ford, U.S.A., and Mr. Philip, who both of them
went to San Stefano every day.</p>

<p>It was at San Stefano that under the outside wall of the town,
and on the railway embankment, the dead and dying were lying
like crushed insects, without shelter, without food, without
water. Miss Alt, a Swiss lady of over seventy, and a friend of
hers, an Austrian lady, Madame Schneider, heard of this state
of things and seeing that nothing was being done for these
people, and that no medical or other assistance was allowed
to be brought them, took the matter into their own hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
and started a relief fund with a sum of £4, and did what they
could for the sick. They turned the deserted Greek school
into a hospital, and they were joined by Mr. Frew, a Scotch
minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in Constantinople.
Funds were then supplied them by the British and American
Embassies, and Major Ford and Mr. Philip joined these two
ladies and Mr. Frew.</p>

<p>The first day I went there, no other medical helpers except
these volunteers had a Turkish sergeant; but the day after, a
Turkish medical officer arrived, and the whole matter was
nominally under his charge. The medical work of the place
was undertaken by Major Ford, and the commissariat was
managed by Mr. Frew. There were in the Greek school nine
rooms altogether. Of these six were occupied by patients,
one formed a kind of kitchen and store-room, and two of the
rooms were taken over by the medical staff of the Turkish Red
Crescent. Besides this there was a compound roofed over in the
open air, and there were a certain number of tents—a dozen or
so. In this house, and in these tents there were at first thrown
together over 350 men, all in various stages of sickness. Some
of them were in the last stage of cholera; some of them had
dysentery; some of them had typhus; some were suffering
from exhaustion and starvation, and the greater part of them
were sick.</p>

<p>At first there was some doubt whether the disease was
cholera. The disease which was manifest—and terribly manifest—did
not include all the best-known symptoms of cholera.
It was plain also that a great number of the soldiers were
suffering simply from exhaustion, exposure, and starvation.
But later on medical diagnosis was made, and the cholera
microbe was discovered. A German cholera specialist who
came from Berlin, Dr. Geissler, told me that there was no
doubt of the existence of the cholera microbe. Besides which,
some of the symptoms were startlingly different from those
of mere dysentery. From the human point of view, and not
from the scientific point of view, the question was indifferent.
The solemn fact from the human point of view was that the
Turkish soldiers at San Stefano were sick and dying from a
disease that in any case in many points resembled cholera, and
that others were dying from what was indistinguishable from
cholera in its outward manifestations. Every day and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
night so many soldiers died, but less and less as the days went
on. One night thirty died; another night fifteen; another
night ten; and so on.</p>

<p>I have called the Greek school a hospital, but when you
think of a hospital you call up the vision of all the luxury of
modern science—of clean beds, of white sheets, of deft and
skilful nurses, of supplies of sterilised water, antiseptics,
lemonade, baths, quiet, space, and fresh and clean air. Here
there were no such appliances, and no such things. There
were no beds; there were mattresses on the dusty and dirty
floors. The rooms were crowded to overflowing. There was
no means of washing or dressing the patients. It is difficult
to convey to those who never saw it the impression made by
the first sight of the rooms in the Greek school where the sick
were lying. Some of the details are too horrible to write. It
is enough to say that during the first few days after the sick
were put into the Greek school, the rooms were packed and
crowded with human beings, some of them in agony and all of
them in extreme distress. They lay on the floor in rows along
the walls, with flies buzzing round them; and between these
rows of men there was a third row along the middle of the room.
They lay across the doors, so that anybody opening a door in
a hurry and walking carelessly into the room trod on a sick
man. They were weak from starvation. They were one and
all of them parched, groaning and moaning, with a torturing
and unquenchable thirst. They were suffering from many
other diseases besides cholera. One man had got mumps.
Many of the soldiers had gangrened feet and legs, all blue, stiff
and rotten, as if they had been frost-bitten. These soldiers
had either to have their limbs amputated or to die—and there is
no future for an amputated Turk. There is nothing for him to
do save to beg. Some of them had swellings and sores and holes
in their limbs and in their faces, and although most of them
were wounded, all of them were unwashed and many of them
covered with vermin. Most of them besides their overcoats
and their puttees had practically no clothes at all. Their
underclothes were in rags, and caked with dirt. The sick were
all soldiers; most of them were Turks; some of them were
Greeks.</p>

<p>In such a place any complicated nursing was out of the
question. The main duties of those who attempted to relieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
the sick consisted in bringing warm clothes and covering to those
who were in rags and shivering; soup to those who were faint
and exhausted, and water to those who were crying for it; and
during the first few days at San Stefano all the sick were crying
for water, and crying for it all day and all night long. You
could not go into any of the rooms without hearing a piteous
chorus of “Doctor Effendi, Doctor Bey, sou, sou” (<i>sou</i> is the
Turkish for water). Luckily the water supply was good.
There was a clean spring not far from the school, and water
mixed with disinfectant could be given to the sick. The sick
and the well at first were crowded together absolutely indiscriminately.
A man who had nothing the matter with him
besides hunger and faintness would be next to a man who was
already rigid and turning grey in the last comatose stage of
cholera.</p>

<p>During the first week of this desperate state of things Miss
Alt and Madame Schneider worked like slaves. They spent the
whole day, and very often the whole night, in bringing clothes
to the ragged, food to the hungry, and water to the thirsty.
Mr. Frew managed the whole commissariat and the food supply,
and he managed it with positive genius. He smoothed over
difficulties, he razed obstacles, and in all the creaking joints
of the difficult machinery he poured the inestimable oil of his
cheerfulness, his good-humour, and his kindness. Major Ford
acted with an equal energy in taking over the medical side of
the school and in sorting from the heaped-up sick those who
were less ill, and separating them from those who were dangerously
ill; and in this task he had the help of Mr. Philip.
This sounds a simple thing to say. It was in practice and in fact
incredibly difficult. During the first days there were scarcely
any orderlies at all and few soldiers, and it was a desperately
slow and difficult task to get people carried from one place to
another. One afternoon, which I shall never forget as long as
I live, Major Ford undertook in one of the crowded rooms to
shift temporarily all the sick from one side of the room to the
other side of it, and while they were there to lay down a
clean piece of oilcloth. This was immensely difficult. The
patients, of course, were unwilling to move. First of all it had
to be explained to them that the thing was not a game, and that
it would be to their ultimate advantage; and then they had to
be bribed from one side of the room to the other with baits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of lemons and cigarettes. Nevertheless, Major Ford managed
to do it and get down a clean piece of oilcloth. When one
had spent the whole day in this place, and one had seen people
like Miss Alt, Madame Schneider, Major Ford, and Mr. Frew
working like slaves from morning till night, one still had the
feeling nothing had been done at all compared with what
remained undone, so overwhelming were the odds. And yet at
the end of one week there was a vast change for the better in
the whole situation.</p>

<p>Great as was the distress of the wretched victims, they were
sublime in their resignation. They consented, like Job, in
what was worse than dust and ashes, to the working of the
Divine will. They most of them had military water-bottles;
they used to implore to have these bottles filled; and when
they were filled—thirsty as they were—they would not drink
all the water, but they kept a little back in order to perform
the ablutions which the Mohammedan religion ordains should
accompany the prayers of the faithful. Even in their agony
the Turks never lost one particle of their dignity, and never
for one moment forgot their perfect manners. They died as
they lived—like the Nature’s noblemen they are—always
acknowledging every assistance; and when they refused a
gift or an offer they put into the refusal the graciousness of
an acceptance.</p>

<p>Only those who have been to Turkey can have any idea of
the politeness, the innate <i>politesse du cœur</i>, of the Turk. One
day when I was coming back from San Stefano on board a Turkish
Government launch, and together with an English officer I was
talking to the Turkish naval officer who was in command of
the launch, the Englishman offered a cigarette to the Turkish
officer. He accepted it and lit it. The Englishman then
offered one to the officer’s younger brother, who was there also.
“He does not smoke,” said the officer. Then he added, after
a pause, “I do not either.” “He has lit and smoked the
cigarette so as not to offend me,” said the Englishman aside
to me. This is typical of the kind of politeness the Turks
show. Equally polite were the soldiers who were dying of a
horrible disease amidst awful conditions. They never forgot
their manners. They were childlike and infinitely pathetic
in their wants. One man in a tent where some of the convalescent
were assembled cried out in Turkish his need—which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
was interpreted to me by a Greek. He wanted a candle, by
which a man, he said, might tell stories to the others; for, he
added, it was impossible for a story-teller to tell stories in the
dark; the audience could not see his face. There was no candle
in the place, but I am not ashamed to say that I stole a small
lamp and gave it to this man to afford illumination to that
story-telling. Another man wanted a lemon. There were
then no lemons. The man produced a five-piastre piece (a
franc, nearly a shilling). This was a large fortune to him, but
he offered it to me if I could get him a lemon. One soldier
refused either to eat or to drink. He would not touch either
soup or milk or water or sour milk, which was the favourite
dish of the soldiers there, and which, being a national dish of
Turkey, could be supplied to them in great quantities. He
kept on reiterating one word. It turned out to mean prune
soup. He was hankering after prune soup. He wanted prune
soup and nothing else. Another man wanted a pencil above
all things, which was duly given him.</p>

<p>The gratitude of these poor people to anyone who did any
little thing for them was immense. “Allah will restore to you
everything you have done for us a hundredfold,” they would
say. Or again: “You are more than a doctor to us; you are
a friend.” One day Mr. Philip brought some flowers to the
sick soldiers. Their delight knew no bounds. The Turks
love flowers. They treasured them. They even sacrificed
their water-bottles—and every drop of water was precious
to them—to keep the flowers fresh a little longer.</p>

<p>The curious resignation of the Turkish character used often
to be manifest in a striking way, in little matters. Here is
an instance which struck me. When lemons or cigarettes, or
indeed anything else, were distributed to the patients, one
cigarette or one lemon, as the case might be, was given to
each man all round the room. Sometimes a patient would ask
for two, and his demand used to arouse the indignation of his
fellow-patients, which they often expressed in violent terms.
Nevertheless, he would persist in his demand, and would keep
on saying: “Give me two, Doctor, give me two”; and finally
one of the Turkish orderlies present would nod his head and
say: “Yes, give him two”; and then he would be given two,
and the other patients, instead of grumbling, would acquiesce
in the <i>fait accompli</i> and say: “Yes, yes, give him two.” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
was curious that they never dreamt of all of them asking for
two of any one thing; but the importunate were acknowledged
to be privileged, if they were sufficiently importunate. One
morning, when lemons were being distributed to the soldiers,
each man receiving a lemon apiece, one, who like the rest
wore a fez, said in a whisper to the distributor: “δῶσέ μοι δύο
εἶμαι Χριστιανός” (“Give me two. I am a Christian”). There
were several Greeks among the sick, and I regret to say that
when they were given shirts they frequently sold them to their
neighbours, and then appeared naked the next day and asked for
another.</p>

<p>Miss Alt’s plan was to give to all who asked—the undeserving
as well as the deserving—and the plan worked out quite well
in the long run, for, as she said, they were none of them too
well off.</p>

<p>After the first few days the Turkish medical authorities
took steps in the matter of the Greek school. During the
first week of the work there, a British unit of the Turkish Red
Crescent arrived from England under the sound direction of Dr.
Baines, and a further recruit joined the helpers in the person
of Lady Westmacott, who brought with her an energetic, clever
and untiring Russian doctor. Although it was impossible
to persuade any of the owners of the houses at San Stefano
to allow them to be used as hospitals, a house was found for
Dr. Baines’ unit. He soon set up a lot of tents, withdrew
from the overcrowded school a number of the patients, and
was able to do excellent work. But he received this house for
himself and his staff on the express condition that no sick of
any kind whatsoever, and not even the owner’s father, should
be allowed to go into it. Later on, a unit of the Egyptian
Red Crescent arrived, with a staff of German doctors and an
Englishman. Wooden barracks were built for them in the plain
outside the Greek school, fronting the sea.</p>

<p>Hard words were said about the Turkish medical authorities
with regard to this matter; and it is, of course, easy
for people who know nothing about the local conditions
and the local difficulties to pass sweeping judgments. On
the whole, I was told by competent authorities, the Turkish
Red Crescent did exceedingly well in dealing with the wounded
and the sick in the large field of their operations. But an
epidemic of cholera such as that which I have described seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
to paralyse them. It took the Turks unprepared. Steps were
taken, but tardily; and to Western minds the procedure seemed
incredibly and criminally slow; yet in the East it is impossible
to do things in a hurry, and if you try to hustle, you will find that
there will be less speed in the long run. If you consider all
these things, the Turkish medical authorities, and especially
the Turkish doctor in charge at San Stefano, did their best
when once they started to work. But when the appalling
situation arose at San Stefano, when the cholera victims were
lying like flies on the railway embankment, they took no
steps to face the situation until they were stimulated to do
so by the example of Miss Alt and Madame Schneider and
the pressure of foreign opinion. This was partly due to the
fatalism of their outlook, to the resignation of their temperament,
and partly to the disorder which was rife throughout
their military organisation. As to San Stefano, which is the
small area I had the opportunity of observing personally, had
it not been for the spontaneous efforts of Miss Alt, Madame
Schneider, and Mr. Frew, the Turkish and Greek soldiers who
were shut up in the cholera camp, without any possibility
of egress, would have died of hunger and thirst. It must be
remembered, as I have said before, that among the cholera
patients there were a great number of soldiers who were
suffering simply and solely from exhaustion and starvation.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the British unit of the Red Crescent,
and that of the Egyptian Red Crescent, matters were got into
shape at San Stefano, and there was no longer need of volunteers.
The worst cases had died. Those who had been suffering from
exhaustion and starvation recovered and were sent home.
Those who had mild attacks of cholera and dysentery became
convalescent, and were moved into the tents. Rooms were
cleared out for the worst cases, and it was possible to introduce
beds, and to clear up matters. What was at the beginning
an ante-chamber to Hell was later, I believe, converted into a
clean hospital with all the necessary appliances and attendants.</p>

<p>That this was done was due to the initial enterprise of Miss
Alt and Madame Schneider. They were the leading spirits
and the soul of this undertaking. Their work was untiring and
incessant. To have seen Miss Alt at work was a rare privilege.
Impervious to disgust, but saturated with pity, overflowing with
love and radiating charity, she threaded her way, bowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
age and with silvered hair, like a good angel or a kind fairy,
from tent to tent, from room to room, laden with gifts; unconscious
of the filth, disdainful of the stench, blind to the
hideous sights, she went her way, giving with both hands,
helping with her arms, cheering with her speech, and healing
with her smile. Miss Alt came to San Stefano like an angel
to Hell, and she could have said, like Beatrice:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FASCINATION OF RUSSIA</span></h2>

<p>From 1912 until the summer of 1914 I spent the greater
part of the year in Russia. I was no longer doing
journalistic work, but I was still writing books on
Russian life and literature. The longer I stayed in Russia,
the more deeply I felt the fascination of the country and
the people. In one of his books Gogol has a passage
apostrophising his country from exile, and asking her the
secret of her fascination. “What is,” he says, “the
inscrutable power which lies hidden in you? Why does
your aching, melancholy song echo forever in my ears?
Russia, what do you want of me? What is there between
you and me?”</p>

<p>The question has often been repeated, not only by Russians
in exile, but by foreigners who have lived in Russia, and I
have often found myself asking it. The country has
little obvious glamour and attraction. In Russia, as Gogol
says, the wonders of Nature are not made more wonderful
by man; there are no spots where Nature, art, and time
combine to take the heart with beauty; where association,
and even decay are indistinguishably mingled; and Nature is
not only beautiful but picturesque; where time has worked
magic on man’s handiwork, and history has left behind a
host of phantoms.</p>

<p>There are many such places in France and in England,
in Italy, Spain, and Greece, but not in Russia. Russia is a
country of colonists, where life has been a perpetual struggle
against the inclemency of the climate, and where the political
history is the record of a desperate battle against adverse
circumstances. Russia’s oldest city was sacked and burnt
just at the moment when it was beginning to flourish; her
first capital was destroyed by fire in 1812; her second capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
dates from the seventeenth century; stone houses are rare
in the country, and the wooden houses are frequently destroyed
by fire. It is a country of long winters and fierce
summers, of rolling plains, uninterrupted by mountains and
unvariegated by valleys.</p>

<p>But the charm is there. It is felt by people of different
nationalities and races; it is difficult, if you live in Russia,
to escape it, and once you have felt it, you will never be
quite free from it. The melancholy song, which Gogol says
wanders from sea to sea over the length and breadth of the
land, will echo in your heart and haunt the corner of your
brain. It is impossible to analyse charm, for if charm could
be analysed it would cease to exist; and it is difficult to
define the character of places where beauty makes so little
instantaneous appeal, and where there is no playground of
romance, and few ghosts of poetry and of history.</p>

<p>Turgeniev’s descriptions of the country give an idea of
this peculiar magic. For instance, the story of the summer
night, when on the plain the children tell each other bogy
tales; or the description of that other July evening, when
out of the twilight, a long way off on the plain, a child’s
voice is heard calling: “Antropka—a—a,” and Antropka
answers: “Wha—a—a—a—a—at?” and far away out of
the immensity comes the answering voice: “Come ho—ome,
because daddy wants to whip you.”</p>

<p>Those who travel in their arm-chair will meet in Turgeniev
with glimpses, episodes, pictures, incidents, sayings and
doings, touches of human nature, phases of landscape, shades
of atmosphere, which contain the secret and the charm of
Russia. All who have travelled in Russia not only recognise
the truth of his pictures, but agree that the incidents which
he records with incomparable art are a common experience to
those who have eyes to see. The picturesque peculiar to
countries rich in historical traditions is absent in Russia; but
beauty is not absent, and it is often all the more striking from
its lack of obviousness.</p>

<p>This was brought home to me strongly in the summer of
1913. I was staying in a small wooden house in Central
Russia, not far from a railway, but isolated from other houses,
and at a fair distance from a village. The harvest was nearly
done. The heat was sweltering. The country was parched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
and dry. The walls and ceilings were black with flies. One
had no wish to venture out of doors until the evening.</p>

<p>The small garden of the house, gay with asters and sweet-peas,
was surrounded by birch trees, with here and there a fir
tree in their midst. Opposite the little house, a broad pathway,
flanked on each side by a row of tall birch trees, led to the
margin of the garden, which ended in a steep grass slope,
and a valley, or a wooded dip; and beyond it, on the same
level as the garden, there was a pathway half hidden by trees;
so that from the house, if you looked straight in front of you,
you saw a broad path, with birch trees on each side of it,
forming a proscenium for a wooded distance; and if anybody
walked along the pathway on the farther side of the dip,
although you saw no road, you could see the figures in outline
against the sky, as though they were walking across the back
of a stage.</p>

<p>Just as the cool of the evening began to fall, out of the
distance came a rhythmical song, ending on a note that seemed
to last for ever, piercingly clear and clean. The music came
a little nearer, and one could distinguish first a solo chanting
a phrase, and then a chorus taking it up, and finally, solo and
chorus became one, and reached a climax on a high note,
which grew purer and stronger, and more and more long
drawn-out, without any seeming effort, until it died away.</p>

<p>The tone of the voices was so high, so pure, and at the
same time so peculiar, strong and rare, that it was difficult
at first to tell whether the voices were tenors, sopranos, or
boyish trebles. They were unlike, both in range and quality,
the voices of women one usually heard in Russian villages.
The music drew nearer, and it filled the air with a majestic
calm. Presently, in the distance, beyond the dip between the
trees, and in the middle of the natural stage made by the
garden, I saw, against the sky, figures of women walking slowly
in the sunset, and singing as they walked, carrying their
scythes and their wooden rakes with them; and once again
the phrase began and was repeated by the chorus; and once
again chorus and solo melted together in a high and long-drawn-out
note, which seemed to swell like the sound of a
clarion, to grow purer, more single, stronger and fuller,
till it ended suddenly, sharply, as a frieze ends. The song
seemed to proclaim rest after toil, and satisfaction for labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
accomplished. It was like a hymn of praise, a broad benediction,
a grace sung for the end of the day: the end of the
summer, the end of the harvest. It expressed the spirit of the
breathless August evening.</p>

<p>The women walked past slowly and disappeared into the
trees once more. The glimpse lasted only a moment, but it
was enough to start a long train of thought and to call up
pictures of rites, ritual, and custom; of rustic worship and
rural festival, of Pagan ceremonies older than the gods.</p>

<p>As another verse of what sounded like a primeval harvest
hymn began, the brief glimpse of the reapers, erect and majestic
in the dress of toil, and laden with the instruments of the
harvest, the high quality of the singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The undisturbed song of pure concent,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">made the place into a temple of august and sacred calm in the
quiet light of the evening. The sacerdotal figures that passed
by, diminutive in the distance, belonged to an archaic vase
or frieze. The music seemed to seal a sacrament, to be the
initiation into an immemorial secret, into some remote mystery—who
knows?—perhaps the mystery of Eleusis, or into still
older secrecies of which Eleusis was the far-distant offspring.
A window had been opened on to another phase of time, on
to another and a brighter world; older than Virgil, older than
Romulus, older than Demeter—a world where the spring,
the summer, and the autumn, harvest-time, and sowing, the
gathering of fruits and the vintage, were the gods; and through
this window came a gleam from the golden age, a breath from
the morning and the springtide of mankind.</p>

<p>When I say that the singing called up thoughts of Greece,
the thing is less fantastic than it seems. In the first place,
in the songs of the Russian peasants, the Greek modes are
still in use: the Dorian, the hypo-Dorian, the Lydian, the
hypo-Phrygian. “La musique, telle qu’elle était pratiquée
en Russie au moyen age” (writes M. Soubier in his <i>History
of Russian Music</i>), “tenait à la tradition des religions et des
mœurs païennes.” And in the secular as well as in the ecclesiastical
music of Russia there is an element of influence which
is purely Hellenic. It turned out that the particular singers
I heard on that evening were not local, but a guild of women
reapers who had come from the government of Tula to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
during the harvest. Their singing, although the form and
kind of song were familiar to me, was different in quality from
any that I had heard before; and the impression made by it
unforgettable.</p>

<p>Nature in Russia is, broadly speaking, monotonous and
uniform, but this does not mean that beauty is rare. Not
only magic moments occur in the most unpromising surroundings,
but beauty is to be found in Russian nature and
Russian landscape at all times and all seasons in many shapes.</p>

<p>For instance: a long drive in the evening twilight at harvest-time,
over the immense hedgeless rolling plains, through stretches
of golden wheat and rye, variegated with millet, still green
and not yet turned to the bronze colour it takes later; when
you drive for miles over monotonous and yet ever-varying
fields, and when you see, in the distance, the cranes, settling
for a moment, and then flying off into space.</p>

<p>Later in the twilight, continents of dove-coloured clouds
float in the east, the west is tinged with the dusty afterglow of
the sunset; and the half-reaped corn and the spaces of stubble
are burnished and glow in the heat; and smouldering fires of
weeds burn here and there; and as you reach a homestead, you
will perhaps see by the threshing-machine, a crowd of dark men
and women still at their work; and in the glow from the flame
of a wooden fire, in the shadow of the dusk, the smoke of
the engine and the dust of the chaff, they have a Rembrandt-like
power; the feeling of space, breadth, and air and immensity
grows upon one; the earth seems to grow larger, the sky to
grow deeper, and the spirit is lifted, stretched, and magnified.</p>

<p>Russian poets have celebrated more frequently the spring
and winter—the brief spring which arrives so suddenly after
the melting of the snows, with the intense green of the birch-trees,
the uncrumpling fern; woods carpeted with lilies of the
valley; the lilac bushes, the nightingale, and later the briar,
which flowers in profusion; and the winter: the long drives
in a sledge under a leaden sky to the tinkle of monotonous
bells; a whistling blizzard with its demons, that lead the horses
astray in the night; transparent woods black against an immense
whiteness; or covered with snow and frozen, an enchanted
fabric against the stainless blue; or, when after a night of thaw,
the brown branches emerge once more covered with airy threads
and sparkling drops of dew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>The sunset and twilight of the winter evening after the first
snow had fallen in December used to be most beautiful. The
new moon, like a little sail on a cold sea, tinged with a blush
as it reached the earth, flooded the snow with light, and added
to its purity; the snow had a blue glint in it and showed
up the wooden houses, the red roofs, the farm implements
in a bold relief; so that all these prosaic objects of everyday
life assumed a strange largeness and darkness as they
loomed between the earth and the sky.</p>

<p>What I used to enjoy more than anything in Russia were
the summer afternoons on the river near Sosnofka, where the
flat banks were covered with oak-trees, ash, willow, and thick
undergrowth; and where every now and then, perch rose to the
surface to catch flies, and the kingfishers skimmed over the
surface from reach to reach. Sometimes I used to take a boat
and row past islands of rushes, and a network of water-lilies, to
where the river broadened; and I reached a great sheet of water
flanked by a weir and a mill. The trees were reflected in the
glassy surface, and nothing broke the stillness but the grumbling
of the mill and the cries of the children bathing.</p>

<p>Near the village, all through the summer night (this was
in June 1914), I used to hear song answering song, and the
brisk rhythm of the accordion; or the interminable humming,
buzzing burden of the three-stringed <i>balalaika</i>; verse succeeded
verse of an apparently tireless song, and the end of each verse
seemed to beget another and give a keener zest to the next;
and the song waxed faster and madder, as if the singer were
intoxicated by the sound of his own music.</p>

<p>But the peculiar manifestations of the beauty of nature in
a flat and uniform country are not enough to account for the
fascination of Russia. Beauty is a part of it, but it is not
all. Against these things in the other scale you had to put
dirt, squalor, misery, slovenliness, disorder, and the uninspiring
wooden provincial towns, the dusty or sodden roads, the
frequent grey skies, the long and heavy sameness.</p>

<p>The <i>advocatus diaboli</i> had a strong case. He could have
drawn up a powerful indictment, not only against the political
conditions, and the arbitrary and uncertain administration,
but also against the character of the people; he could mention
the moral laxity, the extravagant self-indulgence, the lack of
control, the jealousy which hounded any kind of superiority; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
looked with suspicion on all that was original or distinguished;
the dead level of mediocrity; the stereotyped bureaucratic
pattern which you could not escape from. The Russians, he
would say, had all the faults of the Orient without any of its
austerer virtues; Russia, he would say, was a nation of ineffectual
rebels under the direction of a band of corrupt and
time-serving officials. The indictment was true, but however
glaring the faults which Russian moralists, satirists, and
politicians used so frequently and so loudly to deplore, the
faults that used to make foreigners in Russia so angry at times,
they seemed to me the negative results of positive qualities so
valuable as to outweigh them altogether.</p>

<p>During my stays in Russia I saw some of the worst as well
as some of the best aspects of the country and its people.
The net result of all I saw and all I experienced was the sense
of an overpowering charm in the country, an indescribable
fascination in the people. The charm was partly due to the
country itself, partly to the manner of life lived there, and
partly to the nature of the people. The qualities that did
exist, and whose benefit I experienced, seemed to me the most
precious of all qualities; the virtues the most important of all
virtues; the glimpses of beauty the rarest in kind; the songs
and the music the most haunting and most heart-searching;
the poetry nearest to nature and man; the human charity
nearest to God.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the secret of the whole matter, that the
Russian soul is filled with a human Christian charity which is
warmer in kind and intenser in degree, and expressed with a
greater simplicity and sincerity, than is to be met with in any
other people; it was the existence of this quality behind
everything else which gave charm to Russian life (however
squalid the circumstances might be), poignancy to its music,
sincerity and simplicity to its religion, manners, intercourse,
music, singing, verse, art, acting—in a word to its art, its life,
and its faith.</p>

<p>Never did I realise this so much as one day when I was driving
on a cold and damp December evening in St. Petersburg
in a cab. It was dark, and I was driving along the quays from
one end of the town to the other. For a long time I drove
in silence, but after a while I happened to make some remark
to the cabman about the weather. He answered gloomily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
that the weather was bad and so was everything else too. For
some time we drove on in silence, and then in answer to
some other stray remark or question of mine he said he
had been unlucky that day in the matter of a fine. It
was a trivial point, but somehow or other my interest
was aroused, and I got him to tell me the story, which was
a case of bad luck and nothing serious; but when he had
told it, he gave such a profound sigh that I asked whether
it was that which was still weighing upon him. Then he
said “No,” and slowly began to tell me a story of a great
catastrophe which had just befallen him. He possessed a little
land, and a cottage in the country, not far from St. Petersburg.
His house had been burnt. It was true the house was
insured, but the insurance was not sufficient to make an
appreciable difference. He had two sons; one went to
school, and the other had some employment in the provinces.
The catastrophe of the fire had upset everything. All his
belongings had perished. He could no longer send his boy
to school. His second son, in the country, had written to
say he was engaged to be married, and had asked his consent,
advice, and approval. “He has written twice,” said the cabman,
“and I keep silence (<i>i ya molchu</i>). What can I answer?”
I cannot give any idea of the strength, simplicity, and poignancy
of the tale as it came, hammered out slowly, with pauses between
each sentence, with a dignity of utterance and a purity of
idiom which used to be the precious privilege of the poor in
Russia. The words came as if torn out from the bottom of his
heart. He made no complaint; there was no grievance, no
whine in the story. He stated the bald facts with a simplicity
which was overwhelming. In spite of all, his faith in God and
his consent to the will of Providence was unshaken, certain,
and sublime.</p>

<p>This happened in 1911. I have forgotten the details; but I knew
I had been face to face with a human soul, stripped and naked,
and a human soul in the grip of a tragedy. This experience,
which brought one in touch with the divine, is one which, I
think, could only in such circumstances occur in Russia. I
wrote this in the year 1913 when I was summing up my impressions
on Russian life, and trying to analyse the nature
of the fascination the country had for me. When I had
finished, I echoed the words which R. L. Stevenson once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
addressed to a French novelist: “J’ai beau admirer les autres
de toute ma force, c’est avec vous que je me complais à vivre.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1914 I went back to Russia for the
last time before the war. I spent over a month by myself at
Sosnofka, writing a book, an outline of Russian literature,
and bathing every afternoon in the river where the sweetbriar
grew on the banks by the willows, and the kingfisher used every
now and then to dart across the oily-looking water.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful spring. The nightingales sang all day
long in the garden; and all night long people were singing in
the village. Nature was steeped in beauty and calm. It was
a month of accidental retreat before tremendous events and
the changing of the world.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of public events, but I was suddenly seized
with the desire to go home. I debated whether to go or not. I
had finished my book, but as I meant to come back to Russia
in August it seemed perhaps foolish to go. I thought I would
leave it to chance. I decided to take the <i>Sortes Shakespearianæ</i>.
I opened a volume at random, and my pencil fell on the phrase:
“Pack and be gone” (<i>Comedy of Errors</i>, iii. 2, 158). I waited
another day and repeated the experiment. My pencil again
fell on the same line. Then I settled to go. I started one
evening, and in the morning when I arrived at the Friedrichsstrasse
Station at Berlin, I saw in the newspapers the news
of the assassination of the Austrian Archduke. I might have
said: “Incipit vita nova,” but I didn’t. I didn’t even think
it. I was merely conscious of a small cloud on an otherwise
stainless sky.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
